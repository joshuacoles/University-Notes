https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_restriction_theorem

> The **crystallographic restriction theorem** in its basic form was based on the observation that the [rotational symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_symmetry "Rotational symmetry") of a [crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal") are usually limited to 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold.

> However, [quasicrystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal "Quasicrystal") can occur with other diffraction pattern symmetries, such as 5-fold.

Quasicrystals
: A structure that is ordered but not periodic
