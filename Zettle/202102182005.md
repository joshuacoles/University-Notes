- 5 [[Bravais Lattices]] in 2D
- 14 [[Bravais Lattices]] in 3D
- These come from enumerating possible symmetries in 2D/3D.

- If decorated with [[Crystal Basis]] extends to 230
	- Hmm?
- If consider magnetic effects, creating further distinctions, we have 1651.

## Simple Cubic

![[Screenshot 2021-02-18 at 20.10.32.png]]

- [[Bravais Lattices]] and also name for [[crystal structure]] when decorated with [[Crystal Basis]] single atom at (0, 0, 0).

## [[Packing Fraction]]
- Ratio of volume occupied by hard sphere atoms in [[Unit Cell]] to volume of [[Unit Cell]].

## [[Face Centered Cubic]]

- again both a [[Bravais Lattices]] and a basis decorated thing

## [[Body Centered Cubic]]

- Again both BL and CS when decoarated

## [[Cesium Chloride]] / Ionic Structure

similar to [[Body Centered Cubic]] but body item is of a distinct type to the corner centered. This would be easily adopted by -1 / +1 ionic crystals, looking at the unit cell having a 1:1 ratio.
