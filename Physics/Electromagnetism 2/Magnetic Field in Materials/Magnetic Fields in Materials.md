### Paramagnetism

[[Paramagnetism]] is due to the intrinsic [[Magnetic Dipole|Magnetic Dipoles]] of electrons within the orbitals of atoms. These have a tendency to align with an external magnetic field.

Although there are a large number of electrons within a bulk of material, most have no contribution due to the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] meaning only those atoms in unpaired orbitals can contribute. Further thermal excitation also tend to reduce the order of the system.
