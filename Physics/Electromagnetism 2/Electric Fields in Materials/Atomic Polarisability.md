# Atomic Polarisability

Atomic Polarisability is the behaviour of atoms to become polarised (and thus atomic dipoles) in the presence of an external [[Electric Field]] $\E_{\'{ext}}$. For fields that are not too strong[^1] we assume the nuclear core and electron cloud are displaced by a distance $d$ in opposite directions as shown in the diagram below.

[^1]: Standard physics assumptions apply, for example we ignore deformation of the electron cloud, treating it as a **rigid sphere of constant charge**. This is also to avoid ionisation which is the obvious consequence of a sufficiently strong field.

This generates an [[Dipole|Induced Dipole]] given by,

$$ \vp = qd $$

as is standard. Under our assumptions however we assume that this dipole $\vp$ is proportional in strength (and aligned with) the external electric field generating it thus giving us,

$$ \vp = \alpha \E_{\'{ext}}. $$

```ad-info
Note that this wonderful linear relation will become broken in molecules as they may be more readily polarised in some directions than in others.

Further it is also capable of being "rotated", in which case $\alpha$ becomes instead a tensor.

You also of course have permanent dipoles but we will leave that for another day...

## Computation

To compute the value of $\alpha$ we note that in the steady state the Electric Field generated by the Dipole (see [[Dipole#Electric Field]]) is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the external field which generates it. Hence,

$$
\begin{align}
0 &= \E_{\'{ext}} + \E_{\vp} \\
0 &= \E_{\'{ext}} + \frac{-q \vd}{4\pi\epsi_0 r^3}\\
\E_{ext} &= \frac{\vp}{4\pi\epsi_0 r^3} \\
(4\pi\epsi_0 r^3)\E_{\'{ext}} &= \vp \\
\vp &= (3V\epsi_0)\E_{\'{ext}}
\end{align}
$$

where $V$ is the volume of the atom. This gives us an expression for the Atomic Polarisability as,

$$ \alpha = 3V \epsi_0. $$
