# Current Density

The Current Density is defined by its properties,

- The **direction** of $\vJ(\vr)$ is the direction of the current at $\r$. ^9ac418
- The **magnitude** of $\vJ(\vr)$ is the current crossing the unit area perpendicular to $\vJ(\vr)$.

These two properties imply that the total current passing through a surface $S$ is given by,

$$
I = \int_S \vJ \dp \d \vS
$$

Thus establishing the [[Current]] as the [[Vector Flux]] of the [[Current Density]].

We call a specific current density in an experiment a Current Distribution.
