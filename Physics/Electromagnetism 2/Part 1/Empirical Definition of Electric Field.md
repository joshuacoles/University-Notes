# Empirical Definition of Electric Field

From [[Physics/Electromagnetism 2/Part 1/Coloumb's Law]] we can define the [[Electric Field]] empirically as the force experienced by unit charge, near other charge $Q$ with

$$
\vE = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsi_0} Q
$$

having units $\unit{V. m^{-1}} = \unit{N. C^{-1}}$.

This allows us in turn to write Coloumb's Law as,

$$
\vF_e = Q_2 \vE
$$

## Extension to Charge Distributions

Through the [[Principle of Superposition]] we can apply the equation above to more general [[Charge Distributions]]. Hence,

- Let $V'$ be the volume extent of a charged object.
- Let $\rho(\vec{r'})$ be the charge density of that object.

We let,

$$
\vE(\r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsi_0}
\intl_{\vec{r'} \in V'} \rho(\vec{r'}) \rd V
$$

This the [[Integral Form]] of [[Physics/Electromagnetism 2/Part 1/Coloumb's Law]].
