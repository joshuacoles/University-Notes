## The curl of $\vB$ (in constant current situations)

Starting the form the empirical [[Ampere's Law]],

$$
\int_{\partial S} \vB \cdot \d\r = \mu_0 I
$$

where $I$ is the total DC current passing through the surface $S$. Expressed in terms of the [[Current Density]] as,

$$
\int_{\partial S} \vB \cdot \d\r = \mu_0 \int_S \vJ \cdot \d \vec{S}
$$

Which by [[Stokes' Theorem]] is equivalent to,

$$
\int_{\partial S} \vB \cdot \d\r = \int_{S} \curl \vB \dp \d\r = \mu_0 \int_S \vJ \cdot \d \vec{S},
$$

and since the surface $S$ is arbitrary it must be,

$$
\curl \vB = \mu_0 \vJ.
$$

This implies current is a **[[Rotational Source]]** of [[Magnetic Field]]. This is not _quite_ a [[Maxwell's Equations|Maxwell Equations]] as it is only valid for constant [[Current Density]].
