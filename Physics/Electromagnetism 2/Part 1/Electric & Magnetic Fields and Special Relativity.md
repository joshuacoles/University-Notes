# Electric & Magnetic Fields and Special Relativity

^707046

[[Electric Field]] and [[Magnetic Field|Magnetic Fields]] can turn in to each other depending on your [[Frame of Reference]].

Consider a frame of reference where two charges are moving with equal constant velocity away from you. These will exhibit an empirical [[Magnetic Force]] and thus a [[Magnetic Field]].

However now consider a frame which is co-moving with these charges, by [[Special Relativity]] this frame must be **physically equivalent**. Here we see not a [[Magnetic Force]] as from our new perspective, the charges are no longer moving. We do however now see an [[Electrostatic Force]] between the two, which we will compute to be of equal magnitude when taking SR effects into account.

This implies $\vE$ and $\vB$ fields cannot be taken separately, they must be viewed as two parts of the same whole, the [[Electromagnetic Field]] where your [[Frame of Reference]] determines what you view as a [[Magnetic Field]] and what as an [[Electric Field]].
