## Natural Light

Natural Light is known as _"unpolarised"_. This is not that a polarisation does not exist, just that due to the large volume of random uncorrelated events involved in its creation, the lights [[Polarisation]] changes randomly from instant to instant. Thus the average of the polarisation is zero.
