# A Glossary of Electromagnetism

Electromagnetism is formalised on the basis of a number of physically significant Vector Fields namely,

- The [[Electric Field]], $\vE(\r, t)$,
- The [[Magnetic Field]], $\vB(\r, t)$;

and within materials these are split into the auxiliary fields,

- The Displacement Field $\vD$
- The H-Field $\vH$.

These fields are generated by sources,

- [[Current Density]] $\vJ(\r, t)$,
- [[Electric Charge Density]] $\rho(\r, t)$;

although this becomes more complicated in materials as we split charges and currents into different groups for ease of computation.

Further we can also work with this fields instead using Potentials,

- [[Electricstatic Potential]], $\phi$,
- Magnetic Vector Potential, $\vA$;

note that we have only encountered the first in these notes thus far.

## A note on Diagrams

Being sadly restricted to 2D diagrams, we often employ [[Flux Diagrams]] and [[Contour Diagrams]] to represent Vector and Scalar Fields respectively.
