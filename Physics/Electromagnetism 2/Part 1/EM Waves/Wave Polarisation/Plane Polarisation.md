## Plane Polarisation

When $\beta = 0$. In [[Plane Polarisation]] $\vE_0$ is constant over time and is given by,

$$
\vE_0 = \uvi E_{0x} + \uvj E_{0y}.
$$

This is known as [[Plane Polarisation]] as the wave oscillates in the plane defined by $\vE_0$ & $\vec{k}$.

This is also the case if $\beta = \pi$, just $\vE_0 = \uvi E_{0x} - \uvj E_{0y}$.
