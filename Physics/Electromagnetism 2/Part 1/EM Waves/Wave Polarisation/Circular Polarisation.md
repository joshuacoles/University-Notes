## Circular Polarisation

In the case that $\beta = \pm \frac\pi 2$ and $E_{0y} = E_{0x}$ labeled $E_0$, we have [[Circular Polarisation]] given as,

$$
\begin{align*}
\vE_x(z, t) &= \uvi\, E_{0x} \cos(k_z z - \omega t)
\\
\vE_y(z, t) &= \uvj\, E_{0y} \cos(k_z z - \omega t \pm \frac\pi2)
\\ &= \pm \uvj\, E_{0y} \sin(k_z z - \omega t)
\end{align*}
$$

This quite obviously gives us a wave with circular behaviour, where,

- $\|\vE\| = E_{0x}^2 + E_{0y}^2$
- $\vE$ traces a circle either clockwise or anticlockwise dependent on the sign of $\beta$.
- It will have a temporal frequency of $\omega$.

There is a convention to say that anticlockwise is left circular polarisation, and clockwise is right circular. Ahhhh :(
