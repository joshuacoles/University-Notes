# [[Maxwell's Equations]] in [[LIH Materials]]

We now have a version of [[Maxwell's Equations]] which work in materials, namely,

- $\divrg \vD = \rho_f$
- $\divrg \vB = 0$
- $\curl \vE = -\dfrac{\p \vB}{\p t}$
- $\curl \vH = \vJ_f + \dfrac{\p}{\p t} \vD.$

## Constitutive Equations

Within [[LIH Materials]] we also have the additional [[Constitutive Equation|Constitutive Equations]],

- $\vD = \epsi_0\epsi_r \vE$
- $\vP = \epsi_0\chi_e \vE$ ^pol-const
- $\vH = \frac{1}{\mu_0\mu_r} \vB$
- $\vM = \chi_m \vH$
