- Three types of magnetism
  1.  Paramagnetism (torques of native magnetic moments in the material)
      - Net moment created by the subsequent alignment of existing magnetic moments within the material due to the imposition of the external magnetic field.
  2.  Diamagnetism (alteration of the orbital magnetic moments in a material by the imposition of the external)
