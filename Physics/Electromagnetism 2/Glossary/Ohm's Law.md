# Ohm's Law

$$ V = IR $$

which can be written in terms of the vector fields as,

$$ \vJ = \sigma \vE $$ ^vec

where $\sigma$ is the [[Conductivity]] of the material.

```ad-note
[[Conductivity]] is the inverse of [[Resistivity]] which has units $\ohm\mathrm{.m}$. This also explains the change from Potential $V$ to Force Field $\vE$. Sigma has units of $\unit{S.m^{-1} = \ohm^{-1} m^{-1}}$.

We have seen [[Conductivity]] $\sigma$ in the static limit or pseudo-static limit (very slow moving). Of interest here is the [[Optical Conductivity]] $\sigma(\omega)$ which is a generalisation of the static conductivity ($\sigma = \lim_{w \to \infty}\sigma(w)$).
