# EM Waves in LIH Materials

As in the case of a vacuum the first step in modeling EM Waves in a material is by computing their

- [[Governing Equation of EM Waves in an LIH Material]]

Wherein we apply it to two cases

- First an [[EM Waves in Idealised LIH Insulator|Idealised LIH Insulator]],
- Then the more general case of an [[EM Waves in LIH Conductor|LIH Conductor]].

## Properties

From this general case we compute a number of properties,

- [[Dielectric Function]]
- [[Impedance in a Conductor]]
- [[Refractive Index in Conductors]]
- [[Loss Tangent]]
- [[Quantification of Conductivity]]

## Case Studies

- [[Case Study, Poor Conductor]]
- [[Case Study, Good Conductor]]

## Note on Terms

Note that have the following quantities all comprised on some combination of $\epsi, \mu$,

$$
\begin{align}
v_p &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsi\mu}} \\
Z &= \sqrt\frac{\mu}{\epsi} \\
n &= \sqrt{\mu_r\epsi_r}
\end{align}
$$

with the following


$$
Z = \sqrt\frac{\mu}{\epsi} = \sqrt\frac{\mu_r}{\epsi_r}\sqrt\frac{\mu_0}{\epsi_0} = \sqrt\frac{\mu}{\epsi} Z_0
$$

$$
Z = v_p\mu = \frac{1}{v_p\epsi}
$$

$$
v_p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsi\mu}} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsi_r\mu_r}\sqrt{\epsi_0\mu_0}}
= \frac{c}{\sqrt{\epsi_r\mu_r}}
= \frac{c}{n}
$$
