# Refractive Index in Conductors

When we allowed the [[Wave Vector]] and [[Dielectric Function]]to become complex (see [[EM Waves in LIH Conductor#Complex Wave Vector]]) we also lead to a complex [[Refractive Index]].

In non-magnetic materials with $\mu_r = 1$ ([[EM Waves in Idealised LIH Insulator#Phase Speed and Refractive Index]]) we have,

$$
N = \sqrt{\epsi' + i \epsi''}
$$
