# Electromagnetism

The theory of Electromagnetism revolves around

- [[Electric Field]], $\E(\r, t)$
- [[Magnetic Field]], $\B(\r, t)$

Which are generated by moving and stationary [[Electric Charge|Electric Charges]] represented by the source fields,

- [[Current Density]] $\J(\r, t)$
- [[Electric Charge Density]] $\rho(\r, t)$.

For now we will consider only one Potential of this system, the [[Electrostatic Potential]] though in later years we will expand on this.

These fields and their interactions are modeled by [[Maxwell's Equations]].
