## [[Hall Effect]]

The [[Hall Effect]] is observed when you apply a voltage $V$ across a material driving a current $I$, in the presence of a perpendicular [[Magnetic Field]], displayed for a simple cuboid below.

The electrons in the material experience a [[Lorentz Force]] given by $\F = -e(\E + \vv \cp \B)$. This leads to the following situation (top down view, ie in the $xy$-plane)

![[Pasted image 20210329180957.png]]

1. Initially, before the $\B$ field is turned on, the [[Current]] flows in the $-x$ direction with the imposed [[Electric Field]].
2. When $\B$ is initially turned on we experience a transient behaviour where the electrons are deflected in the $-y$ direction.
3. However as the electrons are bound to the material this leads to a charge imbalance across the material and thus an additional [[Electric Field]] eventually reaching a Steady State where this field cancels out the [[Magnetic Field]]. This is similar to a [[Capacitors|Capacitor]].

### Computation

From the [[042. Lec 12, Electrons in solids, Drude model#Equation of Motion]] we have,

![[042. Lec 12, Electrons in solids, Drude model#^262e1d]]

where $\F$ is the [[Lorentz Force]]. Considering now the [[Steady State]], we have the following,

$$
0 = \F - \frac\vp\tau
$$

and further from observation of the situation above,

1. $\E = \uvi E_x + \uvj E_y$
2. $\B = \uvk B$
3. $\vv = \uvi v$

and thus $\vv \cp \B = -\uvj vB$. Applying these observations we can obtain (the bottom two being the $x$ & $y$ components separately)

$$
\begin{align*}
0 &= -e(\E + \vv \cp \B) - \frac{m \vv}\tau \\\\

0 &= -eE_x - \frac{m v}{\tau} \\
0 &= -e(E_y + vB)
\end{align*}
$$

which lead us to

$$
v = \frac{-e\tau}{m}E_x
$$

and

$$
E_y = v_x B.
$$

Recalling [[043. Lec 13, Drude model, DC conductivity#Current Density of Drifting Charges]], we have,

![[043. Lec 13, Drude model, DC conductivity#^current-density-drifting-charges]]

and thus can express $E_y$ in terms of $B$ and $J_x$,

$$
E_y = -\frac{BJ_x}{en}.
$$


We can use this to define the [[Hall Coefficent]] $R_H$ as,

$$
R_H = \frac{E_y}{BJ_x} = \frac{-1}{en}
$$

which we can observe is *independent of* the parameter of the [[Drude Model]] $\tau$. Further still we can define the [[Hall Voltage]] of the system to be,

$$
V_H = E_yw
$$

and the [[Current Density]] $J_x = \frac{I}{wd}$ (where $w$ is the width and $d$ the depth as shown in the [[^img|Image above]]). This allows us to express $R_H$ as,

$$
R_H = \frac{V_H d}{IB}
$$

all of which are *measurable quantities*. This gives us a means to measure the [[Conduction Electron Density]] of a material and also its [[Valence Electrons|valence]] through the ratio,

$$
Z = \frac {n}{\frac{N}{V}} = \frac{-1}{R_H(\frac NV)e}
$$

### Examples

| Metal     | Valence | Valence from Hall Coefficient |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| $\ce{Li}$ | $1$     | $0.9$                         |
| $\ce{Na}$ | $1$     | $0.9$                         |
| $\ce{Zn}$ | $2$     | $1.3$                         |
| $\ce{Cu}$ | $1$     | $1.5$                         |
| $\ce{Cd}$ | $2$     | $-1.6$                        |
| $\ce{Ag}$ | $1$     | $-1.1$                        |
| $\ce{Al}$ | $3$     | $0.2$                         |
| $\ce{Bi}$ | $5$     | $0.0001$                      |

In the above table we see that for the first few elements the value is roughly accurate, however this falls down for others giving much smaller values than anticipated or even negatives! In practice further the values also depend on the temperature and sample preparation, something not predicted by the [[Drude Model]].

The negative values are of specific interest as this implies $R_H > 0$, and possibly *mobile positive charges*.
