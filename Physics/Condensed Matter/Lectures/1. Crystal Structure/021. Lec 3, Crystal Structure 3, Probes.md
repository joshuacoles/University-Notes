Experimental determination of [[Crystal Structure]]. This is done mainly using probes, for example,

- X-Rays.
- Neutrons.
- Electrons.
- Helium Atoms (though this is more usually used for surface structure detection).

The basic idea is,

- Scatter the Probe off a sample, measuring the results.
- Applying [[Bragg's Law]], treating the crystal as a 3D diffraction grating.
- Analysing the scatter intensity pattern, to determine the,
	- [[Crystal Structure]]
		- [[Crystal Lattice]]
		- [[Crystal Basis]]
	- [[Lattice Parameters]]
	- Composition
	- Orientation

This is complemented by specialised techniques such as Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) & Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to determine surface structure.

The detection of the presence of defects, vibrational motion, among other things will not be discussed here, instead we will focus on the bulk of the crystal, the main body of the sample.

## Comparison of Probes

For diffraction on atoms to occur and useful information to be extracted by the probes, we need their [[de Broglie Wavelengths]] to be similar enough to the Atomic Spacing within the Crystal. See the diagram below.

A key insight being that lighter particles have a larger wavelength / heavier shorter, and thus each lend themselves to different circumstances.

> **Note**: we can consider non-relativistic momentum for the [[de Broglie Wavelengths]] in almost all cases as we are only interested in wavelengths on the order of $1\angstrom = 10^{-10} \mathrm{\,m}$.

The important factors of the table above being,

- X-Rays
	- Only scattered by electrons, in a relatively weak interaction (hence the large penetration depth).
	- Thus they are useful as probe of bulk crystal structure.
- Neutrons
	- The neutrons are relatively low energy, and thus must be thermalised to bring them to lower temperature.
	- Do not interact with the light electrons, only the heavier nuclei.
	- Again a weak interaction so useful for probing the bulk structure.
	- These qualities make them complementary to X-Rays, one often revealing information the other did not.
- Electrons
	- Are charged particles so interact strongly with both the nuclei and other electrons. Hence the low penetration depth.
	- Higher energies can penetrate deeper. With the new wavelength being to small to experience diffraction, instead the interaction becoming more ballistic in nature.
	- LEED, Low Energy Electron Diffraction.
	- TEM, Transmission electron microscopy.

> **Programming Note**: This can probably all become one note on probes tbh.
