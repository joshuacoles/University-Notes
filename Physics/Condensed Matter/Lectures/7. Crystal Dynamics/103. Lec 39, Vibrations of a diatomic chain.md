## [[Lattice Vibrations]] in a 1D chain with 2 Atom Basis

![[Pasted image 20210508153015.png]]

Whereas before we focused on the [[Unitary Crystal Basis]], now we will consider a basis of the form, $m: [0], M: [\frac 12]$, with [[Lattice Parameter]] $a$, thus having a repeating pattern as shown above. 

> Note that the position of $M$ within the basis is irrelevant as long as we assume that all displacements are small enough that [[Hooke's Law]] holds true and the force is **only** dependent on the **extension**/displacement, not the overall length (ie we remain within the quadratic region of $V$).

> Note also that wlog we assume $M > m$.

Again modeling this with springs between the atoms, labeling each [[Lattice Point]] by index $s + i, i \in \Z$ and the displacement of $m_s$ by $u_s$, and $M_s$ by $v_s$.

Through the same logic seen in [[102. Lec 38, Vibrations of a monatomic chain]] we end up the following coupled recurring differential equations,

$$
\begin{align}
m\frac{\d^2 u_s}{\d t^2} &= K(v_s + v_{s - 1} - 2u_s) \\
M\frac{\d^2 v_s}{\d t^2} &= K(u_{s + 1} + u_s - 2v_s)
\end{align}
$$

which again from the [[Continuum theory of Longitudinal Vibrations]] assuming wave like solutions for them both, we equal $k$ and $\omega$ values, we obtain (with some [workings elided](marginnote3app://note/B880F8F8-38F1-4244-9610-85638948993B) because I'm lazy, literally sub it in),

$$
\begin{align}
-m \omega^2 u &= K \Bigg(
	\Big[1 + \expp{-ika}\Big]v - 2u
\Bigg) \\

-m \omega^2 v &= K \Bigg(
	\Big[1 + \expp{ ika}\Big]u - 2v
\Bigg)
\end{align}
$$

and the matrix system,

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{2K}{m} & -\frac{K}{m}\Big[1 + \expp{-ika}\Big]
\\
- \frac{K}{M}\Big[1 + \expp{ika}\Big] & \frac{2K}{M}
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix}
=
\omega^2 \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix}
$$

which is clearly an Eigen Problem. 

> Now, this is physics, we are lazy and as I write these notes I am a little pressed for time and wanting to try some newly made Chutney for the first time (I just had a sample with cheese brought to me and *OMG*), so I will continue this tradition and leave a general solution, for another time.

### Dispersion Relation

This gives a dispersion relation of...

$$
\omega^2 =
K\(\frac1m  + \frac1M\)
\pm
K\sqrt{
	\(\frac1m  + \frac1M\)^2 
	- \frac{4}{mM}\sin^2\frac{ka}{2}
}
$$

which is [[Periodic]] and **Even** with period $\frac {2\pi}{a}$. It supports *two* longitudinal modes for each $k$ value as show in the graph below,

Again due to laziness we will focus on $k = 0, \frac{\pi}{a}$ as points of interest ad these are the origin and edge of the [[Brillouin Zone]].

the [[Periodic Contraction]] of this function is sown below with these key values listed.

For small values of $k$ (long wavelength) the bottom branch approaches $0$ and close to that region it is approximatly linear hence [[Dispersionless]], this branch is described by the [[Continuum theory of Longitudinal Vibrations]] and is very similar to that of [[102. Lec 38, Vibrations of a monatomic chain]], expressing similar properties such as a [[Cutoff Frequency]]. It is known as the **acoustic branch**.

The other branch is known as the **optical branch** and has no zero points, instead having a maximum *and* minimum value. Here the mode with $k = 0$ have the two atoms vibrating out of phase as is shown in the top left cell of the table above.

 In ionic solids, positively charged atoms move in opposite direction to negatively charged atoms, creating an oscillating dipole which can couple to an EM field (absorb **infrared radiation**).

At $k = \frac\pi a$, the two modes correspond to one or other atom type being stationary.

### [[Transverse Lattice Vibrations]]

As shown above we also have [[Transverse Wave]] versions of both of these, again both doubly [[Degenerate]].

### Real Solids
