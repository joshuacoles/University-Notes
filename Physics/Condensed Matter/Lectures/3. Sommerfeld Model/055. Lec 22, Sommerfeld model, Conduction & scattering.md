## [[Sommerfeld Theory]] and [[Electrical Conductivity]]

When subjecting electrons to a constant [[Electric Field]] $\E$ they undergo a the [[Lorentz Force]] given by

$$
\vF = -e\E
$$

which applying it to the standard equation of motion (phrase in terms of the [[Wave Vector]] $\vk$),

$$
\begin{align*}
\vF   &= m\dot\vp \\
     &= \hbar \dot\vk \\
-e\E &= \hbar \dot\vk \\\\

\dot\vk &= \frac {-e}{\hbar}\E
\end{align*}
$$

leading to the solution,

$$
\vk(t) = \vk_0 + \frac{-e\E}{\hbar}t
$$

which corresponds with a rigid displacement of the occupied sphere of states, initially equal to the [[Fermi Sphere]] when there is no $\E$ applied.

When there is an $\E \ne 0$ however we can say that the $\langle \vk \rangle \ne 0$ and thus [[Current]] flows as there is no longer a balance of charges with [[Wave Vector|Wave Vectors]] moving left and right. Looking at this quantitatively we will see,

$$
\langle \vk \rangle = \frac{-e\E}{\hbar}t
$$

due to the symmetries of the occupied sphere of states, displayed graphically below.

However this implies that $\lim_{t \to \infty} \vk = \infty \implies \lim_{t \to \infty} I = \infty$ which is clearly non-physical as we know the system will reach a [[Steady State]] of finite constant current given by [[Ohm's Law]]. This implies the existence of some process which works to displace the occupied states back to the origin of the space (as would occur when the current is removed).

This is due to a scattering process corresponding to a change in [[Wave Vector]] of the electrons, the origins of which are impurities/defects in the crystal and also [[Lattice Vibrations]] which on their own would relax the distribution of $\vk$ states.

In the [[Steady State]] of constant [[Current]] above a balance is established between the effects of the constant electric field displacing the $\vk$ vectors, and also the scattering process which push them towards the origin.

### Scattering

There are two kinds of scattering process, *elastic* and *inelastic*, also known as *energy conserving* and *non-energy conserving*.

![[Pasted image 20210401145904.png]]

Since $E \propto \|\vk\|^2$ elastic scattering events preserve the distance of a scattered point from the origin. One should bear in mind however that the largest [[Current Density]] one can realise is $\J \approx 10^7~\mathrm{A.m^{2}}$ which corresponds to a drift velocity of,

$$
v_d = \frac{\J}{ne} \approx \frac{10^7}{10^{28} \times 10^{-19}} \approx 1~\mathrm{cm. s^{-1}}
$$

which is a tiny fraction of $v_f \approx 10^8~\mathrm{cm. s^{-1}}$. Hence those scattering processes involved in current carrying are those involving large momentum changes, from one side of the sphere to the other, but small energy changes. For this reason we often focus on states on the *Surface* of the [[Fermi Sphere]].

## Thermally Excited [[Fermi Sphere]]

At $T = 0$ the occupied sphere of states is the [[Fermi Sphere]] at the origin. However when you heat the system up, this excited some electrons moving them to states outside the sphere. Due to the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] only those states with energy on the order of $k_BT$ of the surface of the [[Fermi Sphere]] are capable of being excited, and they are only excited by an energy of that order.

Thus while [[Electrical Conductivity]] involves scattering processes of high momentum changes but low energy changes, thermal excitation involves scattering small in both regard. This difference is partially responsible for the experimental divergence from the [[Wiedemann-Franz Law]].

This is again a subtle process, with thermal fluctuations only *"smearing"* the [[Fermi Sphere]] by $\frac{T}{T_F} \approx 1\%$.

> Note that this diagram is for a metal sample where the left side is hotter than the right, hence those electrons on the left, traveling right are more excited (there is more sphere on the $+k_x$ side of the sphere).

## [[Resistivity]] in the [[Sommerfeld Theory]]

If there are different scattering processes this implies there could be different scattering rates, $\tau^{-1}$, and thus [[Resistivity|Resistivities]] (cf [[043. Lec 13, Drude model, DC conductivity]]). GIven two samples of Potassium ($\ce{K}$) we observe the [[Resistivity|Resistivities]] to be,

![[Pasted image 20210401155320.png]]

which while they have very different *values*, show the same *temperature dependence*. This implies that the [[Resistivity|Resistivities]] of a sample has both sample dependent and temperature dependent components given below,

$$
\rho = \rho_i + \rho_{\'{ph}}(T)
$$

where $\rho_i$ is sample dependent and due to the impurities in the sample and $\rho_{\'{ph}}$ is due to [[Phonon|Phonons]] / [[Lattice Vibrations]] and is sample independent. These combine to an effective scattering constant,

$$
\frac 1{\tau_{\'{total}}} = \frac 1{\tau_i} + \frac1{\tau_{\'{ph}}}
$$

known as [[Mathiessen's Rule]].
