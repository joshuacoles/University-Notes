## [[Heat Capacity]] in [[Sommerfeld Theory]]

One of the biggest issues with the [[Drude Model]] was in the incorrect prediction with regards to the [[Heat Capacity]] of metals, (cf. [[044. Lec 14, Drude model, Heat capacity]]).

The [[Drude Model]] predicted that the heat capacity of a metal would *increase* with with the [[Valence]] of the atoms, as they would be additional degrees of freedom in which to store energy.

However experimentally this was not the case, with the heat capacity remaining constant at $\approx 3N_Ak_B$ at room temperature, independent of the [[Valence]] (the [[Law of Dulong and Petit]]). This suggests that *electrons do not contribute*.

### Argument 1, As a Physicist

When a solid is heated from $T = 0 \to T > 0$ we would expect an individual electron to gain energy on the order of $k_BT$. However as shown on the diagram below, only a small number of the electrons are in states where the state $\epsi' = \epsi + k_BT$ is free (as per the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]])

This means only a small fraction $\approx\frac{T}{T_F}$ will be excited. This will lead to a change in the [[Internal Energy]] of the electrons approximately equal to,

$$
\Delta U = U(T) - U(0) \approx N \times \frac{T}{T_F} \times k_BT = \frac{Nk_BT^2}{T_F}
$$

this gives us a $C_V$ of the electrons as approximately,

$$
C_V \approx 2N_A k_B\frac{T}{T_F}
$$

which is smaller than the classical result by $\frac{T}{T_F} \approx 1\%$ at room temperature. See below for a graphically example, ( #todo re-go through this)

> Note this is also in accordance with theory we will discuss later in that it is linear in temperature.

### Argument 2, Non-Examinable

See [[Ashcroft & Mermin]] for exact value of,

$$
C_V = \frac{\pi^2}{3}g(\epsi_F)k_B^2T.
$$
