Bloch's theorem states that solutions to the [[Schr√∂dinger Equation]] with a [[Periodic Potential]] take the form of a [[Plane Wave]] multiplied by a periodic function $u(\r)$, given the form,

$$
\psi_{n,\vk}(\r) = \exp(i \vk \dp \r) \dp u_n(\r)
$$

where $\vk$ is the [[Wave Vector]] and $n$ is the [[Band Index]] which distinguishes between many [[Wave Function|Wave Functions]] of the same [[Wave Vector]], differentiated by the periodic component in $u$.

These [[Wave Function|Wave Functions]] are known as [[Bloch Wave|Bloch Waves]] and form a basis solutions for the constructed system.
