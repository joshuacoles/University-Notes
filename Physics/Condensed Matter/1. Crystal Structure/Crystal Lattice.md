# Crystal Lattice

The Crystal Lattice is an infinite set of points determined by the translational symmetries of the structure. Each Lattice Point has identical surroundings to all the others.

The Lattice can be define by a set of [[Primitive Lattice Vector|Primitive Lattice Vectors]], which are vectors between adjacent lattice points, by taking their Integer Span,

$$
\vR = \sum_i n_i \va_i
$$

where $\vR$ is a [[Lattice Vector]] and $\va_i$ the chosen [[Primitive Lattice Vector|Primitive Lattice Vectors]]. From the diagram below it is clear that the choice of [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] is not unique.

The length of these [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] are called the *Lattice Constants* or [[Lattice Parameters]]. They are normally given in either $\mathrm{nm}$ or $\angstrom$. These can be used as an alternative definition of the [[Crystal Lattice]] in terms of the lengths of the [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] and angles between them.
