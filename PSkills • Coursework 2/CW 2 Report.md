## Problem Specification

The question posed in this problem is to simulate the conductivity of disordered materials as a grid of cells, of three varieties: 

- *Insulators*, which block the progression of current.
- *Standard Conductors*, which allow current to progress to directly adjacent cells.
- *Super Conductors*, which allow current to progress into cells both adjacent *and* diagonal.

In addition there are two conducting plates on the top and bottom of the material. Conduction between these plates occurs if there is a path from one plate to the other, formed from the various conductor types, according to the current propagation rules discussed.

The description as provided by the brief is given below.
