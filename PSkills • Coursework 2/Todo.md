- [[Pseudocode]], explain use of counter to find random non-insulator. Say that though this is failable, the probability is low and it reduces the time complexity of generation from $O(L_x \cp L_y)$ to $O(1)$


Note about implementation of 2D as subset of 3D, will only affect time complexity of $x, y, z$ iteration.
