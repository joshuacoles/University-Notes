#### 2.2 Direct sums

Let $\lst {V}1k\leq V$. Any $v\in \plst {V}1k$ can be written

$\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

$$ v=\plst {v}1k, $$

with each $v_i\in V_i$. We distinguish the case where the $v_i$ are _unique_.

###### Definition

. Let $\lst {V}1k\leq V$. The sum $\plst {V}1k$ is _direct_ if each $v\in \plst {V}1k$ can be written

$\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

$$ v=\plst {v}1k $$

in only one way, that is, for unique $v_i\in V_i$, $\bw 1ik$.

In this case, we write $\oplst {V}1k$ instead of $\plst {V}1k$.

###### Example

. Define $V_1,V_2\leq \F ^3$ by

$\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

$$ \begin{align*} V_1&=\set {(x_1,x_2,0)\st x_1,x_2\in \F }\\ V_2&=\set {(0,0,x_3)\st x_3\in \F }. \end{align*} $$ Then $\F ^3=V_1\oplus V_2$.

When is a sum direct? We consider the case of two summands first where there is a very simple answer.

- [[Proposition 2.2]]. Let $V_1,V_2\leq V$. Then $V_1+V_2$ is direct if and only if $V_1\cap V_2=\set 0$.

- Proof. First suppose that $V_1+V_2$ is direct and let $v\in V_1\cap V_2$. Then we can write $v$ in two ways:

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \begin{align*} v&=v_1+0\\&=0+v_2, \end{align*} $$ with $v=v_1=v_2$. The uniqueness of the decomposition now forces $v=0$.

  For the converse, suppose that $V_1\cap V_2=\set 0$ and that $v\in V_1+V_2$ can be written

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ v=v_1+v_2=w_1+w_2 $$

  with $v_i,w_i\in V_i$, $i=1,2$. Then

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ (v_1-w_1)=(w_2-v_2) $$

  with the left hand in $V_1$, the right in $V_2$ and so both in $V_1\cap V_2$ from which we immediately get $v_i=w_i$, $i=1,2$ so that $V_1+V_2$ is direct. □

The special case $V=V_1+V_2$ is important and deserves some terminology:

###### Definition

. Let $V_1,V_2\leq V$. $V$ is the _(internal) direct sum of $V_1$ and $V_2$_ if $V=V_1\oplus V_2$.

In this case, say that $V_2$ is a _complement_ of $V_1$ (and $V_1$ is a complement of $V_2$).

###### Warning

. This notion of the complement of the subspace $V_1$ has _nothing at all_ to do with the set-theoretic complement $V\setminus V_1$ which is never a subspace.

- Remarks.
- - 1. From [[Proposition 2.2]], we see that $V=V_1\oplus V_2$ if and only if $V=V_1+V_2$ and $V_1\cap V_2=\set 0$. Many people take these latter properties as the _definition_ of internal direct sum.
  - 2. There is a related notion of _external_ direct sum that we will not discuss.

When there are many summands, the condition that a sum be direct is a little more involved:

- [[Proposition 2.3]]. Let $\lst {V}1k\leq V$, $k\geq 2$. Then the sum $\plst {V}1k$ is direct if and only if for each $1\leq i\leq k$, $V_i\cap (\sum _{j\neq i}V_j)=\set {0}$.

- Proof. This is an exercise in imitating the proof of [[Proposition 2.2]]. □

- Remark. This is a much stronger condition than simply asking that each $V_i\cap V_j=\set 0$, for $i\neq j$.

##### 2.2.1 Direct sums and projections

###### Definition

. Let $V$ be a vector space. A linear map $\pi :V\to V$ is a _projection_ if $\pi \circ \pi =\pi$.

- Exercise.1 If $\pi$ is a projection, $V=\ker \pi \oplus \im \pi$.

In fact, all direct sums arise this way:

- [[Proposition 2.4]]. Let $V_1,V_2\leq V$ with $V=V_1\oplus V_2$. Then there are projections $\pi _1,\pi _2:V\to V$ such that:

  - (a) $\im \pi _i=V_i$, $i=1,2$;
  - (b) $\ker \pi _1=V_2$, $\ker \pi _2=V_1$;
  - (c) $v=\pi _1(v)+\pi _2(v)$, for all $v\in V$. Otherwise said, $\id _V=\pi _1+\pi _2$.

- Proof. Item (c) tells us how to define the $\pi _i$ so we do this first: for $v\in V$, we have that $v=v_1+v_2$ for unique $v_i\in V_i$, $i=1,2$. So we define $\pi _i(v)$ to be

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \pi \_i(v):=v_i, $$

  for $i=1,2$.

  Our first task is to prove that the $\pi _i$ are linear: for $v,w\in V$ and $\lambda \in \F$, we have

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \begin{align*} v&=\pi \_1(v)+ \pi \_2(v)\\ w&=\pi \_1(w)+ \pi \_2(w)\\ v+\lambda w&=\pi \_1(v+\lambda w)+ \pi \_2(v+\lambda w). \end{align*} $$ However, the first two equalities also give

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ v+\lambda w=(\pi \_1(v)+\lambda \pi \_1(w))+(\pi \_2(v)+\lambda \pi \_2(w)) $$

  so the uniqueness in the third equality gives

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \pi \_i(v+\lambda w)=\pi \_i(v)+\lambda \pi \_i(w), $$

  $i=1,2$, so that both $\pi _i$ are linear.

  By definition, $\im \pi _i\leq V_i$. For the converse, note that, for $v_1\in V_{1}$, we have $v_1=v_1+0$, with $0\in V_2$, so that $\pi _{1}(v_1)=v_1$. In particular, $V_1\leq \im \pi _1$ so that $\im \pi _1=V_1$. Moreover, taking $v_1=\pi _1(v)$, we get $\pi _1(\pi _1(v))=\pi _1(v)$, for any $v\in V$ so that $\pi _1$ is a projection. Similarly $\pi _2$ is a projection and (a) holds.

  Finally, $v=\pi _{1}(v)+\pi _2(v)\in \ker \pi _1$ if and only if $v=\pi _2(v)$, or, as we have just seen, $v\in V_2$. Thus $\ker \pi _1=V_2$ and similarly $\ker \pi _2=V_1$ settling (b). □

As a corollary, we see that dimensions add in direct sums:

- [[Proposition 2.5]]. Let $V=V_1\oplus V_2$ with $V$ finite-dimensional. Then

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \dim V=\dim V_1+\dim V_2. $$

- Proof. We apply the rank-nullity theorem to $\pi _1$:

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \begin{align*} \dim V&=\dim \im \pi *1+\dim \ker \pi *{1}\\ &=\dim V_1+\dim V_2. \end{align*} $$ □

##### 2.2.2 Induction from two summands

A convenient way to analyse direct sums with many summands is to induct from the two summand case. For this, we need:

- [[Lemma 2.6]]. Let $\lst {V}1k\leq V$. Then $\plst {V}1k$ is direct if and only if $\plst {V}1{k-1}$ is direct and $(\plst {V}1{k-1})+V_k$ (two summands) is direct.

- Proof. Suppose first that $\plst {V}1k$ is direct. Then any $v\in \plst {V}1{k-1}$ can be written

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ v=\plst {v}1{k-1}+0 $$

  for unique $v_i\in V_i$, $\bw 1i{k-1}$ so that $\plst {V}1{k-1}$ is direct. Moreover, any $v\in (\plst {V}1{k-1})+V_k=\plst {V}1k$ can be written

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ v=\plst {v}1k=(\plst {v}1{k-1})+v_k $$

  with, in particular, unique $v_k\in V_k$ so that $(\plst {V}1{k-1})+V_k$ is direct.

  For the converse, suppose that $\plst {V}1{k-1}$ and $(\plst {V}1{k-1})+V_k$ are both direct. Then any $v\in \plst {V}1k$ can be written $v=w+v_k$ for unique $w\in \plst {V}1{k-1}$ and $v_k\in V_k$. Also, there is a unique way to write $w$ as

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ w=\plst {v}1{k-1} $$

  with $v_i\in V_i$, $\bw 1i{k-1}$. Putting this together, we get

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ v=\plst {v}1k $$

  for unique $v_i\in V_i$, $\bw 1ik$ so that $\plst {V}1k$ is direct. □

Here is a sample application:

- [[Corollary 2.7]]. Let $\lst {V}1k\leq V$ be subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ with $\plst {V}1k$ direct. Then

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \dim \oplst {V}1k=\plst {\dim V}1k. $$

- Proof. We induct on $k$ using [[Proposition 2.5]] and [[Lemma 2.6]] in the induction step. In more detail: the induction hypothesis is that the formula holds for $k$ summands. The base case reads

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \dim V_1=\dim V_1 $$

  which trivially holds. For the induction step, suppose that the formula holds for any $k-1$ summands. Then, if $\plst {V}1k$ is direct, [[Lemma 2.6]] says that $\plst {V}1{k-1}$ is direct and then the induction hypothesis says that $\dim \oplst {V}1{k-1}=\plst {\dim V}1{k-1}$. Now [[Lemma 2.6]] says that

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \oplst {V}1k=(\oplst {V}1{k-1})\oplus V_k $$

  so that [[Proposition 2.5]] applies to give

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \dim \oplst {V}1k=(\plst {\dim V}1{k-1})+\dim V_k. $$

  □

##### 2.2.3 Direct sums and bases

[[Proposition 2.5]] suggests that there is a relation between the bases of $V_1,V_2$ and the basis of $V_1\oplus V_2$. This is indeed the case:

- [[Proposition 2.8]]. Let $V_1,V_2\leq V$ be finite-dimensional subspaces with bases $\cB _1:\lst {v}1k$ and $\cB _2:\lst {w}1l$. Then $V_1+V_2$ is direct if and only if the \_concatenation_2 $\cB _1\cB _2:\lst {v}1k,\lst {w}1l$ is a basis of $V_1+V_2$.

- Proof. Clearly $\cB _1\cB _2$ spans $V_1+V_2$ and so will be a basis exactly when it is linearly independent.

  Suppose that $V_1+V_2$ is direct and that we have a linear relation $\sum _{i=1}^k\lambda _{i}v_i+\sum _{j=1}^l\mu _jw_j=0$. Then

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \sum _{i=1}^k\lambda _{i}v*i=-\sum *{j=1}^l\mu \_jw_j\in V_1\cap V_2 $$

  which last is the zero subspace by [[Proposition 2.2]]. Thus

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \sum _{i=1}^k\lambda _{i}v*i=\sum *{j=1}^l\mu \_jw_j=0 $$

  so that all the $\lambda _i$ and $\mu _j$ vanish since $\cB _1$ and $\cB _2$ are linearly independent. We conclude that $\cB _1\cB _2$ is linearly independent and so a basis.

  Conversely, if $\cB _1\cB _2$ is a basis and $v\in V_1\cap V_2$, we can write $v$ in two ways: $v=\sum _{i=1}^k\lambda _iv_i$, for some $\lst \lambda 1k\in \F$, since $v\in V_1$ and, similarly, $v=\sum _{j=1}^l\mu _jw_j$. We therefore have a linear relation $\sum _{i=1}^k\lambda _{i}v_i-\sum _{j=1}^l\mu _jw_j=0$ and so, by linear independence of $\cB _1\cB _2$, all $\lambda _i,\mu _j$ vanish so that $v=0$. Thus $V_1\cap V_2=\set 0$ and $V_1+V_2$ is direct by [[Proposition 2.2]]. □

Again, this along with [[Lemma 2.6]] and induction on $k$ yields the many-summand version:

- [[Corollary 2.9]]. Let $\lst {V}1k\leq V$ be finite-dimensional subspaces with $\cB _i$ a basis of $V_i$, $\bw 1ik$. Then $\plst {V}1k$ is direct if and only if the concatenation $\cB _1\ldots \cB _k$ is a basis for $\plst {V}1k$.

2 The concatenation of two lists is simply the list obtained by adjoining all entries in the second list to the first.

##### 2.2.4 Complements

For finite-dimensional vector spaces, any subspace has a complement:

- [[Proposition 2.10]] (Complements exist). Let $U\leq V$, a finite-dimensional vector space. Then there is a complement to $U$.

- Proof. Let $\cB _1:\lst {v}1k$ be a basis for $U$ and so a linearly independent list of vectors in $V$. By [[Proposition 1.3]], we can extend the list to get a basis $\cB :\lst {v}1n$ of $V$. Set $W=\Span {\lst {v}{k+1}n}\leq V$: this is a complement to $U$.

  Indeed, $\cB _2:\lst {v}{k+1}n$ is a basis for $W$ and $\cB =\cB _1\cB _2$ so that $V=U\oplus W$ by [[Proposition 2.8]]. □

In fact, as Figure 2.3 illustrates, there are many complements to a given subspace.

![(A subspace has many complements.)](M216-notes-images/image-4.svg)

Figure 2.3: Each dashed line is a complement to the undashed subspace.

Here is an application:

- [[Proposition 2.11]] (Extension of linear maps). Let $V,W$ be vector spaces with $V$ finite-dimensional. Let $U\leq V$ be a subspace and $\phi :U\to W$ a linear map. Then there is a linear map $\Phi :V\to W$ such that the restriction3 of $\Phi$ to $U$ is $\phi$: $\Phi \restr {U}=\phi$. Otherwise said: for all $u\in U$

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \Phi (u)=\phi (u). $$

- Proof. By [[Proposition 2.10]], $U$ has a complement and so, by [[Proposition 2.4]], there is a projection $\pi :V\to V$ with image $U$.

  Set $\Phi =\phi \circ \pi :V\to W$. This is a linear map and

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \Phi \restr {U}=\phi \circ \pi \restr {U}=\phi $$

  since, for $u=\pi (v)\in \im \pi =U$, $\pi (u)=\pi (\pi (v))=\pi (v)=u$. □

3 Recall that if $f:X\to Y$ is a map of sets and $A\sub X$ then the _restriction_ of $f$ to $A$ is the map $f\restr {A}:A\to Y$ given by $f\restr {A}(a)=f(a)$, for all $a\in A$.
