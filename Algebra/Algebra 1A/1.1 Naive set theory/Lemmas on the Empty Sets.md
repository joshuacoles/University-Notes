## Lemmas on the Empty Sets

### Universal Subset

If $A$ is empty, then $A \subseteq B$ for any set $B$ .

#### Proof

Since $x \in A$ is never true, the implication $x \in A \implies x \in B$ holds vacuously for any $B$.

### Uniqueness

If $A$ and $B$ are both empty, then $A = B$ .

#### Proof

By [[#Lemma 1.2]], $A \subseteq B$ , because $A$ is empty, and $B \subseteq A$ , because $B$ is empty. Hence $A = B$ , as required.
