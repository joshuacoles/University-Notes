## 4.4 Cosets and Lagranges Theorem

Definition 4.29.  
  
For any subgroup $H \leq G$, the **left cosets** of $H$ are

$$
g H = \set{ g h : h \in H }
$$

for each $g \in G$, while the **right cosets** of $H$ are

$$
H g = \set{ h g : h \in H }
$$

for each $g \in G$ .

For example, consider the group $G = ℤ_{7}^{*}$ with subgroup $H = \left<2\right> = \set{ 1, 2, 4 }$ and write a partial Cayley table.

$$
\begin{align}
\cdot & 1 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 5 & 6 \\ 1 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 5 & 6 \\ 2 & 2 & 4 & 1 & 6 & 3 & 5 \\ 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 5 & 6 & 3
\end{align}
$$

The columns give the right cosets $H g$, so we see that these are either $H = \set{ 1, 2, 4 }$ or $\set{ 3, 5, 6 }$. Note that $H = H e$ is always one coset and we always have $g \in H g$ because $e \in H$ . In this example, observe that the cosets actually form a partition of $G$ and are the all same size. This is a general fact as we shall now see.

Proposition 4.30.  
  
The left cosets $\set{ g H : g \in G }$ form a partition of $G$ (and so do the right cosets, by a similar argument).

Proof. Notice that

$$
x \in g H \Leftrightarrow \exists h \in H : x = g h \Leftrightarrow g^{- 1} x \in H .
$$

Hence it suffices to prove that the relation $x sim g$, defined by $g^{- 1} x \in H$, is an equivalence relation on $G$, because then the class $\left[ g \right] = \set{ x \in G : x sim g } = g H$ .

(R): $g sim g$ as $g^{- 1} g = e \in H$, by (S2).

(S): If $x sim y$, i.e. $y^{- 1} x \in H$, then $((y^{- 1} x))^{- 1} = x^{- 1} y \in H$, by (S3), i.e. $y sim x$ .

(T): If $x sim y$ and $y sim z$, i.e. $y^{- 1} x \in H$ and $z^{- 1} y \in H$, then

$$
z^{- 1} x = (z^{- 1} y) (y^{- 1} x) \in H, \text{ by (S1), i.e. }xsimz .
$$

Thus $sim$ is an equivalence relation and its equivalence classes $g H$ partition $G$ Prop. [1.38]. □

Example 4.31.  
  
**(a)** For the additive group $G = ℤ$ and (additive cyclic) subgroup $H = n ℤ$ [N.B. $n ℤ = \set{ n k : k \in ℤ }$ is **not** a coset, as the group operation is addition], the cosets (left and right coincide as addition is commutative) are

$$
r + H = \set{ r + n k : k \in ℤ },
$$

which are the congruence classes. Indeed, the defining relation

$$
x sim y \Leftrightarrow x - y \in n ℤ \Leftrightarrow n | x - y
$$

is precisely congruence mod $n$ .

**(b)** If $G = ℝ^{2} = ℝ \times ℝ$ as an additive group and $H$ is any line through the origin $(0, 0)$, i.e. the identity element in $ℝ^{2}$, then $H$ is a subgroup and the coset $p + H$ is the line parallel to $H$ through $p$ .

Theorem 4.32 (Lagrange).  
  
If $G$ is a finite group and $H \leq G$, then $\left|H\right|$ divides $\left|G\right|$ .

Proof. Each coset $g H$ has size $\left|H\right|$, because the map $m_{g} : G \to G : x \to g x$ is a bijection (with inverse $m_{g^{- 1}}$) and so $m_{g}$ restricts to an injection $H \to G$ and thus a bijection $H \to g H =m_{g}(H)$ . But the cosets form a partition of $G$ [Prop. [4.30](#x8-20002r30)] and so, if there are $k$ cosets, then $\left|G\right| = k \left|H\right|$, as required. □

If there are finitely many cosets, then their number is called the **index** of $H$ in $G$, written $\left|G : H\right|$, so we can write Lagrange’s theorem as

$$
\left|G\right| = \left|G : H\right| \cdot \left|H\right| .
$$

Note that index can be finite even if $\left|G\right|$ isn’t, e.g. $\left|ℤ : n ℤ\right| = n$ .

Corollary 4.33.  
  
If $G$ is a finite group and $g \in G$, then $ord (g)$ divides $\left|G\right|$ .

Proof. Have seen that $ord (g) = \left|\left<g\right>\right|$ and that $\left<g\right> \leq G$ [Example [4.15](#x8-18012r15)(d)]. □

Example 4.34.  
  
Applications of (corollary to) Lagrange’s Theorem.

**(a)** If $\left|G\right|$ is prime, then $G$ is cyclic.

Proof. If $e \neq g \in G$, then $ord g \neq 1$ and divides $\left|G\right|$, so $ord g = \left|G\right|$, as $\left|G\right|$ is prime. That is, $\left|\left<g\right>\right| = \left|G\right|$, so $\left<g\right> = G$ and thus $G$ is cyclic. □

**(b) Euler’s Theorem:** $x^{\phi (n)} \equiv 1 (mod n)$, where $\phi (n)$ is Euler’s phi-function Thm. [2.30].

Proof. Recall that $\left|ℤ_{n}^{*}\right| = \phi (n)$, so for any $x \in ℤ_{n}^{*}$ we know that $ord x$ divides $\phi (n)$, say $ord x = m$ and $\phi (n) = m k$, and hence $x^{\phi (n)} = ((x^{m}))^{k}=1^{k} = 1$ . □

Proposition 4.35.  
  
If $\alpha : G \to H$ is a homomorphism, then the fibres

$$
(\alpha)^{- 1} (h) = \set{ g \in G : \alpha (g) = h }
$$

for $h \in im \alpha$ are precisely the cosets of $Ker \alpha$ .

Proof. The fibres are precisely the equivalence classes for the relation $x sim y$, defined by $\alpha (x) = \alpha (y)$ . But

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha(x)=\alpha(y) & \Leftrightarrow & \alpha((x))^{- 1}\alpha(y)=e_{H} &  \\ & \Leftrightarrow & \alpha(x^{- 1} y)=e_{H}\text{(as }\alpha\text{ is a homomorphism)} &  \\ & \Leftrightarrow & x^{- 1}y\in Ker\alpha, 
\end{align}
$$

which is precisely the equivalent relation whose classes are the (left) cosets of $Ker \alpha$ . □

Notice that we could have done the argument on the other side and found that the same fibres are the right cosets of $Ker \alpha$, showing that, in this case, the left and right cosets coincide, even though the group $G$ is not assumed to be abelian.

Corollary 4.36.  
  
If $G$ and $im (\alpha)$ are finite, then all fibres have the same size $\left|Ker \alpha\right|$ and the number is $\left|im \alpha\right|$, so $\left|G\right| = \left|Ker \alpha\right| \cdot \left|im \alpha\right|$ .

Example 4.37.  
  
$sgn : S_{n} \to \set{ \pm 1 }$ is a homomorphism and $Ker (sgn) = A_{n}$, the subgroup of even permutations. The other coset $\tau A_{n}$, for any odd $\tau$, is the set of all odd permutations (cf. Remark [4.1](#x8-170004.1)(a)).
