# Abelian Group

If a [[Group]] is [[Commutative]] in addition to the other three axioms it is known as an **Abelian Group**. Thus,

$$
a * b = b * a \quad \Forall a, b \in G
$$

## Notation

The binary operation in an Abelian Group is often written as $+$, in which case the identity element is denoted $0$ and the inverse of an element $a \in G$ is denoted $-a$.
