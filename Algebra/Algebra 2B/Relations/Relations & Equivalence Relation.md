# Relations & Equivalence Relation

**1.34** We begin with a bit of set theory. Let $X$ be a set: recall that a _relation_ $\sim$ on $X$ is simply a subset $\Sigma \subset X\times X$ and we write $x\sim y$ if (and only if) $(x,y)\in \Sigma$.

An _equivalence_ relation on $X$ is a relation $\sim$ that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, and in that case the _equivalence class_ of an element $x\in X$ is the (nonempty) set $[x]=\{y\in X \mid x\sim y\}$ of elements that are equivalent to $x$. Every element lies in a unique equivalence class, and any two distinct equivalences classes are disjoint subsets of $X$; we say that the equivalence classes _partition_ the set $X$. The set of equivalence classes $\{[x]\mid x\in X\}$ is denoted $X/\sim$.
