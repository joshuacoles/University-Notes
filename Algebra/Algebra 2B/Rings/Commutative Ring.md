# Commutative Ring

A [[Ring]] $R$ is a **[[Commutative]] Ring** iff

$$
a \cdot b = b \cdot a \quad\Forall a, b \in R
$$

One does not say “abelian ring”! In contexts where only commutative rings are important, one sometimes drops the word “commutative”, and explicitly says “noncommutative ring” where necessary, but that will not be done here.
