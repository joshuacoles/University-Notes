#### 1.4 Linear maps

###### Definitions

. A map $\phi :V\to W$ of vector spaces over $\F$ is a _linear map_ (or, in older books, _linear transformation_) if

$\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{1}$

$$ \begin{align*} \phi (v+w)&=\phi (v)+\phi (w)\\ \phi (\lambda v)&=\lambda \phi (v), \end{align*} $$ for all $v,w\in V$, $\lambda \in \F$.

The _kernel_ of $\phi$ is $\ker \phi :=\set {v\in V\st \phi (v)=0}\leq V$.

The _image_ of $\phi$ is $\im \phi :=\set {\phi (v)\st v\in V}\leq W$.

- Remark. $\phi$ is linear if and only if

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{1}$

  $$ \phi (v+\lambda w)=\phi (v)+\lambda \phi (w), $$

  for all $v,w\in V$, $\lambda \in \F$, which has the virtue of being only one thing to prove.

###### Examples

###### Definition

. A linear map $\phi :V\to W$ is a _(linear) isomorphism_ if there is a linear map $\psi :W\to V$ such that

$\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{1}$

$$ \psi \circ \phi =\id \_V,\qquad \phi \circ \psi =\id \_W. $$

If there is an isomorphism $V\to W$, say that $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic and write $V\cong W$.

In Algebra 1B, we saw:

- [[Lemma 1.5]]. $\phi :V\to W$ is an isomorphism if and only if $\phi$ is a linear bijection (and then $\psi =\phi ^{-1}$).

##### 1.4.1 Vector spaces of linear maps

###### Notation

. For vector spaces $V,W$ over $\F$, denote by $L_{\F }(V,W)$ (or simply $L(V,W)$) the set $\set {\phi :V\to W\st \text {$\phi $ is linear}}$ of linear maps from $V$ to $W$.

- [[Theorem 1.6]] (Linearity is a linear condition). $L(V,W)$ is a vector space under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication. Otherwise said, $L(V,W)\leq W^V$.

- Proof. It is enough to show that $L(V,W)$ is a vector subspace of $W^V$, that is, is non-empty and closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

  First observe that the zero map $0:v\mapsto 0\in W$ is linear:

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{1}$

  $$ 0(v+\lambda w)=0=0+\lambda 0=0(v)+\lambda 0(w). $$

  In particular, $L(V,W)$ is non-empty.

  Now let $\phi ,\psi \in L(V,W)$ and show that $\phi +\psi$ is linear:

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{1}$

  $$ \begin{align*} (\phi +\psi )(v+\lambda w) &=\phi (v+\lambda w)+\psi (v+\lambda w)\\ &=\phi (v)+\lambda \phi (w)+\psi (v)+\lambda \psi (w)\\ &=(\phi (v)+\psi (v))+\lambda (\phi (w)+\psi (w))\\ &=(\phi +\psi )(v)+\lambda (\phi +\psi )(w), \end{align*} $$ for all $v,w\in V$, $\lambda \in \F$. Here the first and last equalities are just the definition of pointwise addition while the middle equalities come from the linearity of $\phi ,\psi$ and the vector space axioms of $W$.

  Similarly, it is a simple exercise to see that if $\mu \in \F$ and $\phi \in L(V,W)$ then $\mu \phi$ is also linear. □

##### 1.4.2 Linear maps and matrices

Recall from Algebra 1B §2.6:

###### Definition

. Let $V,W$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces over $\F$ with bases $\cB :\lst {v}1n$ and $\cB ':\lst {w}1m$ respectively. Let $\phi \in L(V,W)$. The _matrix of $\phi$ with respect to $\cB ,\cB '$_ is the matrix $A=(A_{ij})\in M_{m\times n}(\F )$ defined by:

$\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{1}$

$$ \label {eq:27} \phi (v*j)=\sum *{i=1}^mA*{ij}w*{i}, $$

for all $\bw 1jn$.

In the special case where $V=W$ _and_ $\cB =\cB '$, we call $A$ the _matrix of $\phi$ with respect to $\cB$_.

Thus the recipe for computing $A$ is: _expand $\phi (v_j)$ in terms of $\lst {w}1m$ to get the $j$-th column of $A$_.

Equivalently, $\phi (\lc {x}v1n)=\lc {y}w1m$ where

$\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{2}$

$$ \by =A\bx . $$

There is a fancy way to say all this: recall that a basis $\cB :\lst {v}1n$ of $V$ gives rise to a linear isomorphism $\phi _{\cB }:\F ^n\to V$ via

$\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{2}$

$$ \label {eq:3} \phi _{\cB }\vec \lambda 1n=\sum _{i=1}^n\lambda \_iv_i. $$

Now the relation between $\phi$ and $A$ is that

$\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{3}$

$$ \phi =\phi _{\cB '}\circ \phi \_A\circ \phi _{\cB }^{-1} $$

or, equivalently, $\phi _{\cB '}\circ \phi _A=\phi \circ \phi _{\cB }$ so that the following diagram commutes:

![(math image)](M216-notes-images/image-1.svg)

(The assertion that such a diagram commutes is simply that the two maps one builds by following the arrows in two different ways coincide. However, the diagram also helps us keep track of where the various maps go!)

The map $\phi \mapsto A$ is a linear isomorphism $L(V,W)\cong M_{m\times n}(\F )$ which also plays well with composition and matrix multiplication: if $U$ is a third vector space with basis $\cB ''$ and $\psi \in L(W,U)$ has matrix $B$ with respect to $\cB ',\cB ''$ then $\psi \circ \phi$ has matrix $BA$ with respect to $\cB ,\cB ''$. This gives us a compelling dictionary between linear maps and matrices.

##### 1.4.3 Extension by linearity

A linear map of a finite-dimensional vector space is completely determined by its action on a basis. More precisely:

- [[Proposition 1.7]] (Extension by linearity). Let $V,W$ be vector spaces over $\F$. Let $\lst {v}1n$ be a basis of $V$ and $\lst {w}1n$ _any_ vectors in $W$.

  Then there is a _unique_ $\phi \in L(V,W)$ such that

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{3}$

  $$ \label {eq:2} \phi (v_i)=w_i,\qquad 1\leq i\leq n. $$

- Proof. We need to prove that such a $\phi$ exists and that there is only one. We prove existence first.

  Let $v\in V$. By [[Proposition 1.1]], we know there are unique $\lst \lambda 1n\in \F$ for which

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{4}$

  $$ v=\lc {\lambda }{v}1n $$

  and so we define $\phi (v)$ to be the only thing it could be:

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{4}$

  $$ \phi (v):=\lc \lambda {w}1n. $$

  Let us show that this $\phi$ does the job. First, with $\lambda _i=1$ and $\lambda _j=0$, for $i\neq j$, we see that

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{4}$

  $$ \phi (v*i)=\sum *{j\neq i}0w_j+1w_i=w_i $$

  so that (1.4) holds. Now let us see that $\phi$ is linear: let $v,w\in V$ with

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{4}$

  $$ \begin{align*} v&=\lc \lambda {v}1n\\ w&=\lc \mu {v}1n. \end{align*} $$ Then, for $\lambda \in \F$,

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{4}$

  $$ v+\lambda w=(\lambda \_1+\lambda \mu \_1)v_1+\dots +(\lambda \_n+\lambda \mu \_n)v_n $$

  whence

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{4}$

  $$ \begin{align*} \phi (v+\lambda w) &=(\lambda \_1+\lambda \mu \_1)w_1+\dots +(\lambda \_n+\lambda \mu \_n)w_n\\ &=(\lc \lambda {w}1n)+\lambda (\lc \mu {w}1n)\\ &=\phi (v)+\lambda \phi (w). \end{align*} $$

  For uniqueness, suppose that $\phi ,\phi '\in L(V,W)$ both satisfy (1.4). Let $v\in V$ and write $v=\lc \lambda {v}1n$. Then

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{4}$

  $$ \begin{align*} \phi (v)&=\lambda \_1\phi (v_1)+\dots +\lambda \_n\phi (v_n)\\ &= \lc \lambda {w}1n\\ &=\lambda \_1\phi '(v_1)+\dots +\lambda \_n\phi '(v_n)\\ &=\phi '(v), \end{align*} $$ where the first and last equalities come from the linearity of $\phi ,\phi '$ and the middle two from (1.4) for first $\phi$ and then $\phi '$. We conclude that $\phi =\phi '$ and we are done. □

- Remark. In the context of [[Proposition 1.7]], $\phi$ is an isomorphism if and only if $\lst {w}1n$ is a basis for $W$ (exercise3!).

3 This is question 2 on exercise sheet 2.

##### 1.4.4 The rank-nullity theorem

Easily the most important result in Algebra 1B is the famous Rank-nullity theorem:

- [[Theorem 1.8]] (Rank-nullity). Let $\phi :V\to W$ be linear with $V$ finite-dimensional. Then

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{4}$

  $$ \dim \im \phi +\dim \ker \phi =\dim V. $$

Using this, together with the observation that $\phi$ is injective if and only if $\ker \phi =\set {0}$, we saw in Algebra 1B:

- [[Proposition 1.9]]. Let $\phi :V\to W$ be linear with $V,W$ finite-dimensional vector spaces of the same dimension: $\dim V=\dim W$.

  Then the following are equivalent:

  - 1. $\phi$ is injective.
  - 2. $\phi$ is surjective.
  - 3. $\phi$ is an isomorphism.

- Remark. [[Proposition 1.9]] is flat-out false for infinite-dimensional $V,W$. For example: let $S:\R ^{\N }\to \R ^{\N }$ be the _shift_ operator:

  $\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{4}$

  $$ S((a_0,a_1,\dots )):=(a_1,\dots ). $$

  We readily check that:

  - • $S$ is linear;
  - • $S$ surjects;
  - • $S$ is not injective. For example: $S((1,0,0,\dots ))=0$.
