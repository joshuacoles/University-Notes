### Chapter 3 Inner product spaces

In this chapter, we equip real or complex vector spaces with extra structure that generalises the familiar dot product.

###### Convention

. In this chapter, we take the field $\F$ of scalars to be either $\R$ or $\C$.

#### 3.1 Inner products

##### 3.1.1 Definition and examples

Recall the dot (or scalar) product on $\R ^n$: for $x=\vec {x}1n,y=\vec {y}1n\in \R ^{n}$,

$\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{0}$

$$ x\cdot y:=\lc {x}{y}1n=\bx ^T\by . $$

Using this we define:

- • the _length_ of $x$: $\norm {x}:=\sqrt {x\cdot x}$;
- • the _angle_ $\theta$ between $x$ and $y$: $x\cdot y=\norm {x}\norm {y}\cos \theta$.

There is also a dot product on $\C ^n$: for $x,y\in \C ^n$,

$\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{0}$

$$ x\cdot y=\lc {\bar {x}}{y}1n=\bx ^{\dagger }\by , $$

where $\bx ^{\dagger }$ (pronounced “x-dagger”) is the conjugate transpose $\bar {\bx }^T$ of $\bx$. We then have that

$\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{0}$

$$ x\cdot x=\sum _{i=1}^n\bar {x}\_ix_i=\sum _{i=1}^n\abs {x_i}^2 $$

is real, non-negative and vanishes exactly when $x=0$.

We abstract the key properties of the dot product into the following:

###### Definition

. Let $V$ be a vector space of $\F$ (which is $\R$ or $\C$).

An _inner product_ on $V$ is a map $V\times V\to \F :(v,w)\mapsto \ip {v,w}$ which is:

- (1) _(conjugate) symmetric_: $\ip {w,v}=\overline {\ip {v,w}}$, for all $v,w\in V$. In particular $\ip {v,v}=\overline {\ip {v,v}}$ and so is real.
- (2) _linear in the second slot_:

  $\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{0}$

  $$ \begin{align*} \ip {u,v+w}&=\ip {u,v}+\ip {u,w}\\ \ip {u,\lambda v}&=\lambda \ip {u,v}, \end{align*} $$ for all $u,v,w\in V$ and $\lambda \in \F$.

- (3) _positive definite:_ For all $v\in V$, $\ip {v,v}\geq 0$ with equality if and only if $v=0$.

A vector space with an inner product is called an _inner product space_.

- Remark. Any subspace $U$ of an inner product space $V$ is also an inner product space: just restrict $\ip {\, ,\,}$ to $U\times U$.

Let us spell out the implications of this definition in the real and complex cases.

Suppose first that $\F =\R$. Then the conjugate symmetry is just symmetry: $\ip {v,w}=\ip {w,v}$ and it follows that we also have linearity in the first slot:

$\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{0}$

$$ \begin{align*} \ip {v+w,u}&=\ip {v,u}+\ip {w,u}\\ \ip {\lambda v,u}&=\lambda \ip {v,u}. \end{align*} $$ We summarise the situation by saying that a real inner product is a _positive definite, symmetric, bilinear form_. We shall have more to say about bilinear forms later in chapter 6.

Now let us turn to the case $\F =\C$. Now it is not the case that an inner product is linear in the first slot.

###### Definition

. A map $\phi :V\to W$ of complex vector spaces is _conjugate linear_ (or _anti-linear_) if

$\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{0}$

$$ \begin{align*} \phi (v+w)&=\phi (v)+\phi (w) \\ \phi (\lambda v)&=\bar {\lambda }\phi (v), \end{align*} $$ for all $v,w\in V$ and $\lambda \in \F$.

We see from properties (1) and (2) that a complex inner product has

$\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{0}$

$$ \begin{align*} \ip {v+w,u}&=\ip {v,u}+\ip {w,u}\\ \ip {\lambda v,u}&=\bar {\lambda }\ip {v,u} \end{align*} $$ and so is conjugate linear in the first slot and linear in the second. Such a function is said to be _sesquilinear_ (from the Latin _sesqui_ which means one-and-a-half). Thus an inner product on a complex vector spaces is a _positive definite, conjugate symmetric, sesquilinear form_.

###### Definition

. Let $V$ be an inner product space.

- 1. The _norm_ of $v\in V$ is $\norm {v}:=\sqrt {\ip {v,v}}\geq 0$.
- 2. Say $v,w\in V$ are _orthogonal_ or _perpendicular_ if $\ip {v,w}=0$. In this case, we write $v\perp w$.

- Remarks.
- - 1. The norm allows us to define the _distance_ between $v$ and $w$ by $\norm {v-w}$. We can now do analysis on $V$: this is one of the Big Ideas in MA20218.
  - 2. **Warning**: There is another convention for complex inner products which is prevalent in Analysis: there they ask that $\ip {\, ,\,}$ be linear in the _first_ slot and conjugate linear in the second. There are good reasons for either choice.
  - 3. Physicists often write $\ip {v\vert w}$ for $\ip {v,w}$. Inner product spaces (especially infinite-dimensional ones) are the setting for quantum mechanics.

###### Examples

.

- Remark. Perhaps surprisingly, $\ell _2$ and $C^0[a,b]$ are closely related: this is what Fourier series are about: see MA20223.

##### 3.1.2 Cauchy–Schwarz inequality

Here is one of the most important and ubiquitous inequalities in all of mathematics:

- [[Theorem 3.1]] (Cauchy–Schwarz inequality). Let $V$ be an inner product space. For $v,w\in V$,

  $\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{1}$

  $$ \label {eq:21}\abs {\ip {v,w}}\leq \norm {v}\norm {w} $$

  with equality if and only if $v,w$ are linearly dependent, that is, either $v=0$ or $w=\lambda v$, for some $\lambda \in \F$.

- Proof. The idea of the proof is to write $w=\lambda v+u$ where $u\perp v$ (see Figure 3.1) and then use the fact that $\norm {u}^2\geq 0$.

  In detail, first note that if $v=0$ then both sides of the inequality vanish and there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, let us seek $\lambda \in \F$ so that $u:=w-\lambda v\perp v$. We therefore need

  $\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{2}$

  $$ 0=\ip {v,w-\lambda v}=\ip {v,w}-\lambda \ip {v,v} $$

  so that

  $\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{2}$

  $$ \lambda =\frac {\ip {v,w}}{\norm {v}^2}. $$

  The situation is shown in Figure 3.1.

  ![(How to construct u.)](M216-notes-images/image-7.svg)

  Figure 3.1: Construction of $u$.

  With $\lambda$ and then $u$ so defined we have

  $\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{2}$

  $$ \begin{align*} 0\leq \norm {u}^{2} &=\ip {w-\lambda v,u}=\ip {w,u}=\ip {w,w-\lambda v} \\ &=\ip {w,w}-\lambda \ip {w,v}\\ &=\norm {w}^2-\frac {\abs {\ip {v,w}}^{2}}{\norm {v}^2}, \end{align*} $$ where we used the sesquilinearity of the inner product to reach the second line and the conjugate symmetry to reach the third. Rearranging this yields

  $\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{2}$

  $$ \abs {\ip {v,w}}^2\leq \norm {v}^2\norm {w}^2 $$

  and taking a square root gives us the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.

  Finally, we have equality if and only if $\norm {u}=0$ or, equivalently, $u=0$, that is, $w=\lambda v$. □

###### Examples

.

The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality is an essentially $2$-dimensional result about the inner product space $\Span {v,w}$. Here are some more that are almost as fundamental:

- [[Proposition 3.2]]. Let $V$ be an inner product space and $v,w\in V$.

  - 1. **Pythagoras Theorem**: If $v\perp w$ then

    $\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{2}$

    $$ \label {eq:22} \norm {v+w}^2=\norm {v}^2+\norm {w}^2. $$

  - 2. **Triangle inequality**: $\norm {v+w}\leq \norm {v}+\norm {w}$ with equality if and only if $v=0$ or $w=\lambda v$ with $\lambda \geq 0$.
  - 3. **Parallelogram identity**: $\norm {v+w}^2+\norm {v-w}^2=2(\norm {v}^2+\norm {w}^2)$.

Figure 3.2: The identities of [[Proposition 3.2]]

- Proof.
- - 1. Exercise2: expand out $\norm {v+w}^2=\ip {v+w,v+w}$.
  - 2. We prove $\norm {v+w}^2\leq (\norm {v}+\norm {w})^2$. We have

    $\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{3}$

    $$ \norm {v+w}^2=\norm {v}^2+2\mathrm {Re}\ip {v,w}+\norm {w}^2. $$

    Now,

    $\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{3}$

    $$ \mathrm {Re}\ip {v,w}\leq \abs {\ip {v,w}}\leq \norm {v}\norm {w} $$

    by Cauchy–Schwarz so that

    $\seteqnumber{0}{3.}{3}$

    $$ \norm {v+w}^2\leq \norm {v}^2+2\norm {v}\norm {w}+\norm {w}^2=(\norm {v}+\norm {w})^2 $$

    with equality if and only if $\mathrm {Re}\ip {v,w}=\abs {\ip {v,w}}=\norm {v}\norm {w}$ in which case we first get $w=\lambda v$, for some $\lambda \in \F$, and then that $\mathrm {Re}\lambda =\abs {\lambda }$ so that $\lambda \geq 0$.

  - 3. Exercise3!
