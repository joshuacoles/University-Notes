#### 5.2 Solution sets and annihilators

Here is one way to think about $V^{*}$: consider the equation

$\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{1}$

$$ \label {eq:25} \alpha (v)=0, $$

for some $\alpha \in V^{*}$ and $v\in V$. If we choose dual bases $\lst {v}1n$ and $\dlst {v}1n$ of $V$ and $V^{*}$, (5.2) reads

$\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

$$ \lc \alpha {x}1n=0 $$

where we have written $\alpha =\lc \alpha {v^{*}}1n$ and $v=\lc {x}v1n$. This is a single homogeneous linear equation.

This gives us the idea of viewing $V^{*}$ as the set of linear equations on $V$. From this point of view, a subspace $E\leq V^{*}$ should be viewed as a system of linear equations and so we should be interested in the solutions of that system:

###### Definition

. Let $E\leq V^{*}$. The _solution set of $E$_ is

$\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

$$ \sol E:=\set {v\in V\st \text {$\alpha (v)=0$, for all $\alpha \in E$}}=\bigcap \_{\alpha \in E}\ker \alpha \leq V. $$

- Exercise.3 If $\lst \alpha 1k$ span $E$ then

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ \sol E=\bigcap \_{i=1}^k\ker \alpha \_i. $$

For finite-dimensional $V$, one might expect each equation in a linear system to reduce the dimension of the solution set by one and this is exactly what happens:

- [[Proposition 5.7]]. If $V$ is finite-dimensional and $E\leq V^{*}$ then

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ \dim \sol E=\dim V-\dim E. $$

  We say that $E$ and $\sol E$ have _complementary dimension_.

- Proof. Let $\dlst {v}1k$ be a basis of $E$ and extend to a basis $\dlst {v}1n$ of $V^{*}$. Let $\lst {v}1n$ be the dual basis of $V$ provided by [[Proposition 5.5]].

  Now $E=\Span {\dlst {v}1k}$ so that $\sol E=\bigcap _{i=1}^k\ker v^{*}_i$. Thus $v=\sum _{j=1}^n\lambda _jv_j$ lies in $\sol E$ if and only if $\lambda _i=v^{*}_i(v)=0$, for $\bw 1ik$. Otherwise said,

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ \sol E=\Span {\lst {v}{k+1}n} $$

  so that

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ \dim \sol E=n-k=\dim V-\dim E. $$

  □

- Remark. Here is a slicker argument. Let $\ev ^E:V\to E^{*}$ be the linear map given by

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ \ev ^E(v)(\alpha )=\alpha (v). $$

  - 1. $\im \ev ^E=E^{*}$: for this, you use [[Theorem 5.6]] along with the fact that restriction to $E$ is a surjection from $V^{**}$ to $E^{*}$ thanks to [[Proposition 2.11]].
  - 2. $\ker \ev ^E=\set {v\in V\st \text {$\alpha (v)=0$, for all $\alpha \in E $}}=\sol E$.

  So rank-nullity tells us that

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ \dim \sol E+\dim E^{\*}=\dim V $$

  and, since $\dim E=\dim E^{*}$, we are done.

- [[Corollary 5.8]]. Let $V$ have dimension $n$ and suppose that $\lst {\alpha }1n\in V^{*}$ are such that

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ \bigcap \_{i=1}^n\ker \alpha \_i=\set 0. $$

  Then $\lst \alpha 1n$ is a basis of $V^{*}$.

- Proof. Let $E:=\Span {\lst \alpha 1n}$. The hypothesis says that $\sol E=\set 0$ so, by [[Proposition 5.7]], $\dim E=n$ whence $E=V^{*}$. Thus $\lst \alpha 1n$ span $V^{*}$ and so are a basis. □

Here is an application:

###### Example

. Let $P_2$ be the vector space of polynomials of degree at most $2$. Thus $\dim P_2=3$.

Define $\alpha _i:P_2\to \R$, $i=1,2,3$, by

$\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

$$ \begin{align*} \alpha \_1(p)&=p(1)\\ \alpha \_2(p)&=p(\sqrt {2})\\ \alpha \_3(p)&=p(\pi ), \end{align*} $$ for all $p\in P_2$. These are all linear maps so that $\alpha _1,\alpha _2,\alpha _3\in P_2^{*}$. We apply [[Corollary 5.8]] so see that $\alpha _1,\alpha _2,\alpha _3$ are a basis of $P_2^{*}$. Indeed, if $p\in \bigcap _{i=1}^3\ker \alpha _i$ then $p(1)=p(\sqrt {2})=p(\pi )=0$ so that $p$ has three distinct roots and so must vanish since it has degree no more than $2$.

Thus any $\alpha \in P_2^{*}$ is a linear combination of the $\alpha _i$. For example, define $\alpha$ by

$\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

$$ \alpha (p)=\int \_0^1p. $$

Then there are $\lambda _1,\lambda _2,\lambda _3\in \R$ such that $\alpha =\lambda _1\alpha _1+\lambda _2\alpha _2+\lambda _3\alpha _3$. Otherwise said, we have found clever $\lambda _i$ such that, for all $p\in P_2$,

$\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

$$ \int \_0^1p=\lambda \_1p(1)+\lambda \_2p(\sqrt {2})+\lambda \_3p(\pi ). $$

Solution sets behave somewhat like orthogonal complements (except that $E$ and $\sol E$ live in entirely different vector spaces):

- [[Proposition 5.9]]. Let $E,F\leq V^{*}$. Then

  - (1) If $E\leq F$ then $\sol F\leq \sol E$.
  - (2) $\sol$ swaps sums and intersections:

    $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

    $$ \begin{align*} \sol (E+F)&=(\sol E)\cap (\sol F)\\ (\sol E)+(\sol F)&\leq \sol (E\cap F) \end{align*} $$ with equality if $V$ is finite-dimensional.

- Proof.
- - (1) Let $E\leq F$ and $v\in \sol F$. Then $\alpha (v)=0$, for all $\alpha \in F$ and so, in particular, for all $\alpha \in E$. Thus $v\in \sol E$.
  - (2) This is an exercise4 similar to one you have already done about orthogonal complements5.

  □

Still thinking of $V^{*}$ as the linear equations on $V$, we can turn things around and ask which equations the elements of a subspace $U\leq V$ satisfy:

###### Definition

. Let $U\leq V$. The _annihilator of $U$, denoted $\ann U$ or $U^{\circ }$_, is given by:

$\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

$$ \ann U:=\set {\alpha \in V^{_}\st \alpha \_{|U}=0}=\set {\alpha \in V^{_}\st \text {$\alpha (u)=0$, for all $u\in U$ }}. $$

- Exercise.6 Show that $\ann U\leq V^{*}$.

Annihilators have very similar properties to solution sets. They also have complementary dimension:

- [[Proposition 5.10]]. Let $V$ be finite-dimensional and $U\leq V$. Then

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ \dim \ann U=\dim V-\dim U. $$

- Proof. This is an exercise7 in imitating the proof of [[Proposition 5.7]]: start with a basis $\lst {v}1k$ of $U$, extend to a basis $\lst {v}1n$ of $V$ and see that $\ann U=\Span {\dlst {v}{k+1}n}$. Can you find a slick argument? □

Again annihilators swap the order of inclusions and sums with intersections:

- [[Proposition 5.11]]. Let $U,W\leq V$. Then

  - (1) If $U\leq W$ then $\ann W\leq \ann U$.
  - (2)

    $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

    $$ \begin{align*} \ann (U+W)&=(\ann U)\cap (\ann W)\\ (\ann U)+(\ann W)&\leq \ann (U\cap W) \end{align*} $$ with equality if $V$ is finite-dimensional.

- Proof. This is an exercise8 in imitating the proof of [[Proposition 5.9]]. □

What is the relation between annihilators and solution sets?

- [[Lemma 5.12]]. Let $U\leq V$ and $E\leq V^{*}$ then $U\leq \sol E$ if and only if $E\leq \ann U$.

- Proof. Both inclusions amount to saying $\alpha (u)=0$, for all $u\in U$ and $\alpha \in E$. □

With this in hand, we have:

- [[Theorem 5.13]]. Let $U\leq V$ and $E\leq V^{*}$. Then

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ \begin{align*} U&\leq \sol (\ann U)\\ E&\leq \ann (\sol E), \end{align*} $$ with equality if $V$ is finite-dimensional.

- Proof. Clearly $\ann U\leq \ann U$ so putting $E=\ann U$ in [[Lemma 5.12]] gives

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ U\leq \sol (\ann U). $$

  Similarly, $\sol E\leq \sol E$ so [[Lemma 5.12]] gives

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ E\leq \ann (\sol E). $$

  If $V$ is finite-dimensional,

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ \dim \sol (\ann U)=\dim V-\dim \ann U=\dim U $$

  so that $U=\sol (\ann U)$. Similarly, $E=\ann (\sol E)$. □

- Remark. We can view $\ann$ and $\sol$ as maps:

  $\seteqnumber{0}{5.}{2}$

  $$ \begin{align*} \ann :\set {\text {subspaces of $V$}}&\to \set {\text {subspaces of $V^{*}$}}\\ \sol :\set {\text {subspaces of $V^{*}$}}&\to \set {\text {subspaces of $V$}}. \end{align\*} $$ When $V$ is finite-dimensional, [[Theorem 5.13]] is telling us that these maps are mutually inverse bijections. This has a beautiful application to geometry that you can see in MA30231.
