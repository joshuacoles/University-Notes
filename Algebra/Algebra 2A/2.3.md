#### 2.3 Quotients

Let $U\leq V$. We construct a new vector space from $U$ and $V$ which is an “abstract complement” to $U$. The elements of this vector space are equivalence classes for the following equivalence relation:

###### Definition

. Let $U\leq V$. Say that $v,w\in V$ are _congruent modulo $U$_ if $v-w\in U$. In this case, we write $v\equiv w\mod U$.

###### Warning

. This is emphatically not the relation of congruence modulo an integer $n$ that you studied in Algebra 1A: here the relation is between vectors in a vector space. However, both notions of congruence are examples of a general construction in group theory.

- [[Lemma 2.12]]. Congruence modulo $U$ is an equivalence relation.

- Proof. Exercise4! □

Thus each $v\in V$ lies in exactly one equivalence class $[v]\sub V$.

What do these equivalence classes look like? Note that $w\equiv v\mod U$ if and only if $w-v\in U$ or, equivalently, $w=v+u$, for some $u\in U$.

###### Definition

. For $v\in V$, $U\leq V$, the set $v+U:=\set {v+u\st u\in U}\sub V$ is called a _coset of $U$_ and $v$ is called a _coset representative_ of $v+U$.

We conclude that the equivalence class of $v$ modulo $U$ is the coset $v+U$.

- Remark. In geometry, cosets of vector subspaces are called _affine subspaces_. Examples include lines in $\R ^2$ and lines and planes in $\R ^3$ irrespective of whether they contain zero (as vector subspaces must).

###### Example

. Fibres of a linear map: let $\phi :V\to W$ be a linear map and let $w\in \im \phi$. Then the _fibre of $\phi$ over $w$_ is defined by:

$\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

$$ \phi ^{-1}\set {w}:=\set {v\in V\st \phi (v)=w}. $$

Unless $w=0$, this is not a linear subspace but notice that $v,v'$ are in the same fibre if and only if $\phi (v)=\phi (v')$, or, equivalently, $\phi (v-v')=0$ or $v-v'\in \ker \phi$. We conclude that the fibres of $\phi$ are exactly the cosets of $\ker \phi$:

$\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

$$ \phi ^{-1}\set {w}=v+\ker \phi , $$

for any $v\in \phi ^{-1}\set {w}$.

We shall see below that any coset arises this way for a suitable $\phi$.

###### Definition

. Let $U\leq V$. The _quotient space $V/U$ of $V$ by $U$_ is the set $V/U$, pronounced “$V$ mod $U$”, of cosets of $U$:

$\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

$$ V/U:=\set {v+U\st v\in V}. $$

This is a subset of the \_power set_5 $\mathcal {P}(V)$ of $V$.

The _quotient map_ $q:V\to V/U$ is defined by

$\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

$$ q(v)=v+U. $$

The quotient map $q$ will be important to us. It has two key properties:

- 1. $q$ is surjective.
- 2. $q(v)=q(v')$ if and only if $v\equiv v'\mod U$, that is, $v-v'\in U$.

We can add and scalar multiply cosets to make $V/U$ into a vector space and $q$ into a linear map:

- [[Theorem 2.13]]. Let $U\leq V$. Then, for $v,w\in V$, $\lambda \in \F$,

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \begin{align*} (v+U)+(w+U)&:=(v+w)+U\\ \lambda (v+U)&:=(\lambda v)+U \end{align*} $$ give well-defined operations of addition and scalar multiplication on $V/U$ with respect to which $V/U$ is a vector space and $q:V\to V/U$ is a linear map.

  Moreover, $\ker q=U$ and $\im q=V/U$.

- Proof. We phrase everything in terms of $q$ to keep the notation under control. Since $q$ surjects, we lose nothing by doing this: any element of $V/U$ is of the form $q(v)$ for some $v\in V$.

  With this understood, the proposed addition and scalar multiplication in $V/U$ read

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \begin{align*} q(v)+q(w)&:=q(v+w)\\\lambda q(v)&:=q(\lambda v) \end{align*} $$ so that $q$ is certainly linear so long as these operations make sense. Here the issue is that if $q(v)=q(v')$ and $q(w)=q(w')$, we must show that

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ \label {eq:7} q(v+w)=q(v'+w'),\qquad q(\lambda v)=q(\lambda v'). $$

  However, in this case, we have $v-v'\in U$ and $w-w'\in U$ so that

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{1}$

  \begin{gather*} (v+w)-(v'+w')=(v-v')+(w-w')\in U\\ \lambda v-\lambda v'=\lambda (v-v')\in U, \end{gather*} since $U$ is a subspace, and this establishes (2.1).

  As for the vector space axioms, these follow from those of $V$. For example:

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{1}$

  $$ q(v)+q(w)=q(v+w)=q(w+v)=q(w)+q(v). $$

  Here the first and third equalities are the definition of addition in $V/U$ and the middle one comes from commutativity of addition in $V$. The zero element is $q(0)=0+U=U$ while the additive inverse of $q(v)$ is $q(-v)$.

  The linearity of $q$ comes straight from how we defined our addition and scalar multiplication while $v\in \ker q$ if and only if $q(v)=q(0)$ if and only if $v=v-0\in U$ so that $\ker q=U$. □

- [[Corollary 2.14]]. Let $U\leq V$. If $V$ is finite-dimensional then so is $V/U$ and

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{1}$

  $$ \dim V/U=\dim V-\dim U. $$

- Proof. Apply rank-nullity to $q$ using $\ker q=U$ and $\im q=V/U$. □

- Remark. [[Theorem 2.13]] shows that:

  - 1. Any $U\leq V$ is the kernel of a linear map.
  - 2. Any coset $v+U$ is the fibre of a linear map: indeed

    $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{1}$

    $$ v+U=q^{-1}\set {q(v)}. $$

###### Commentary

. Many people find the quotient space $V/U$ difficult to think about: its elements are (special) subsets of $V$ and this can be confusing.

An alternative, perhaps better way, to proceed is to concentrate instead on the _properties_ of $V/U$ in much that same way that, in Analysis, we deal with real numbers via the axioms of a complete ordered field without worrying too much what a real number actually is!

From this point of view, the quotient $V/U$ of $V$ by $U$ is a vector space along with a linear map $q:V\to V/U$ such that

- • $q$ surjects;
- • $\ker q=U$

and this is really all you need to know!

The content of [[Theorem 2.13]], from this perspective, is simply that quotients exist!

- [[Theorem 2.15]] (First Isomorphism Theorem). Let $\phi :V\to W$ be a linear map of vector spaces.

  Then $V/\ker \phi \cong \im \phi$.

  In fact, define $\bar {\phi }:V/\ker \phi \to \im \phi$ by

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{1}$

  $$ \bar {\phi }(q(v))=\phi (v), $$

  where $q:V\to V/\ker \phi$ is the quotient map.

  Then $\bar {\phi }$ is a well-defined linear isomorphism.

- Proof. First we show that $\bar {\phi }$ is well-defined: $q(v)=q(v')$ if and only if $v-v'\in \ker \phi$ if and only if $\phi (v-v')=0$, or, equivalently, $\phi (v)=\phi (v')$. We also get a bit more: $\bar {\phi }$ injects since if $\bar {\phi }(q(v))=\bar {\phi }(q(v'))$ then $\phi (v)=\phi (v')$ which implies that $q(v)=q(v')$.

  To see that $\bar {\phi }$ is linear, we compute using the linearity of $q$ and $\phi$:

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{1}$

  $$ \bar {\phi }(q(v_1)+\lambda q(v_2))= \bar {\phi }(q(v_1+\lambda v_2))= \phi (v_1+\lambda v_2)= \phi (v_1)+\lambda \phi (v_2)= \bar {\phi }(q(v_1))+\lambda \bar {\phi }(q(v_2)), $$

  for $v_1,v_2\in V$, $\lambda \in \F$.

  It remains to show that $\bar {\phi }$ is surjective: but if $w\in \im \phi$, then $w=\phi (v)=\bar {\phi }(q(v))$, for some $v\in V$, and we are done. □

- Remarks.
- - 1. Let $q:V\to V/\ker \phi$ be the quotient map and $i:\im \phi \to W$ the inclusion. Then the First Isomorphism Theorem shows that we may write $\phi$ as the composition $i\circ \bar {\phi }\circ q$ of a quotient map, an isomorphism and an inclusion.
  - 2. This whole story of cosets, quotients and the First Isomorphism Theorem has versions in many other contexts such as group theory (see MA30237) and ring theory (MA20217).
