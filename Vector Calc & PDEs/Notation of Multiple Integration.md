Notationally we will generally use the number of integral signs to represent the number of **quantities** which we are integrating against, so,

- Single Integral: $\displaystyle\int f(x) \,\d x$
- Double Integral: $\displaystyle\iint f(x, y) \,\d x\, \d y$
- Triple Integrals: $\displaystyle \iiint f(x, y, z) \,\d x \,\d y \,\d z$

However if we are operating directly with surface or volume elements, or other "n" dimensional quantities it is a choice of the moment if to include more than one integral sign.
