# [[Face Centered Cubic Crystal Lattice]]

![[FCC Slide.pdf]]

This both the name given to the [[Bravais Lattices]] and also the [[Crystal Structure]] when decorated with the single atom [[Crystal Basis|basis]] $(0, 0, 0)$.

This can also be represented as a 4 atom [[Crystal Basis]], 8 $\frac 18$th on the corners, 6 $\frac 12$ves on the faces. We can compute a [[Conventional Unit Cell]] for this [[Crystal Structure]] as,

- The bottom left corner $(0,0,0)$.
- The three faces closest to it, $\(\frac 12,\frac 12, 0\), \(\frac 12, 0, \frac 12\), \(0, \frac 12,\frac 12\)$.

This can also be expressed in the form of a [[Primitive Unit Cell]], as shown below

$$
\vec a_1 = \frac{a}{2}(\hat x + \hat y),
\hspace{.5cm}
\vec a_2 = \frac{a}{2}(\hat y + \hat z),
\hspace{.5cm}
\vec a_3 = \frac{a}{2}(\hat x + \hat z).
