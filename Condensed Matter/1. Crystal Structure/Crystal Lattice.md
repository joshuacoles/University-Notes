# Crystal Lattice

The Crystal Lattice is an infinite set of points determined by the translational symmetries of the structure. Each Lattice Point has identical surroundings to all the others.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Lattice can be define by a set of [[Primitive Lattice Vector|Primitive Lattice Vectors]], which are vectors between adjacent lattice points, by taking their Integer Span,

$$
\vR = \sum_i n_i \va_i
$$

where $\vR$ is a [[Lattice Vector]] and $\va_i$ the chosen [[Primitive Lattice Vector|Primitive Lattice Vectors]]. From the diagram below it is clear that the choice of [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] is not unique.

The length of these [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] are called the *Lattice Constants* or [[Lattice Parameters]]. They are normally given in either $\mathrm{nm}$ or $\angstrom$. These can be used as an alternative definition of the [[Crystal Lattice]] in terms of the lengths of the [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] and angles between them.

The lattice can be defined by [[Primitive Lattice Vector]], which are vectors between Lattice Points, these are not unique. For example,

The set of lattice points is the span of these [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] over the Integers. A vector of this form is known as a [[Lattice Vector]].
