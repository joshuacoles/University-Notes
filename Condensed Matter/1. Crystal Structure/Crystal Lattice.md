# Crystal Lattice

The Crystal Lattice is an infinite set of points determined by the translational symmetries of the structure. Each Lattice Point has identical surroundings to all the others.

The lattice can be defined by [[Primitive Lattice Vector]], which are vectors between Lattice Points, these are not unique. For example,

The set of lattice points is the span of these [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] over the Integers. A vector of this form is known as a [[Lattice Vector]].

The length of these [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] are called the *lattice constants* or [[Lattice Parameters]]. They are normally given in either $\mathrm{nm}$ or $\angstrom$. These can be used as an alternative definition of the [[Crystal Lattice]] in terms of the lengths of the [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] and angles between them.
