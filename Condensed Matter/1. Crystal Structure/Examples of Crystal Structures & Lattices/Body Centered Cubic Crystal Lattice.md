# [[Body Centered Cubic Crystal Lattice]]

Again, this the name of the [[Crystal Lattice]] and also the [[Crystal Structure]] formed when imposing the [[Unitary Crystal Basis]] $(0,0,0)$.

![[BCC Slide.pdf]]

The [[Conventional Unit Cell]] for this structure is a 2 atom basis ($8 \times \frac 18 \text{ (corner) } + 1 \text{ (inside)}$) imposed on a [[Simple Cubic Crystal Lattice]].

> So for all of these we are expressing a complex crystal lattice, as a basis on a more simple one I think? Right?
