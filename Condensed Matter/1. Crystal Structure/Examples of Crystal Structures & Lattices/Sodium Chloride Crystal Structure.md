# [[Sodium Chloride Crystal Structure]]

This crystal structure is another frequently adopted by ionic compounds. It can be expressed either as a [[Simple Cubic Crystal Lattice]] with a two atom heterogeneous [[Crystal Basis]] of #todo; or a [[Face Centered Cubic Crystal Lattice]] with a basis $r: (0,0,0), g: (\frac 12, \frac 12, \frac 12)$.
