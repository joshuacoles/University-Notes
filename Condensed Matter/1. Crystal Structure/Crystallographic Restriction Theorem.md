https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_restriction_theorem

The **crystallographic restriction theorem** in its basic form was based on the observation that the rotational symmetries of a [[Crystal]] are usually limited to 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold.

However, [[Quasicrystals]]( "Quasicrystal") can occur with other diffraction pattern symmetries, such as 5-fold.
