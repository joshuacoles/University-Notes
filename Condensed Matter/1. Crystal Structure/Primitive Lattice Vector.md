These are the [[Lattice Vector|Lattice Vectors]] between [[Lattice Point|Lattice Points]], generate the [[Crystal Lattice]] through their Integer Linear Span,

$$
\vR = \sum\vn_i\va_i = n_1\va + n_2\vb+ n_3\vc
$$

where $\vn \in \N^n$. Hence they form a Basis of sorts over the.

Note that they are not unique as shown below,
