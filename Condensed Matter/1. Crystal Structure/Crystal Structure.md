The Crystal Structure is generated from two components the,

- [[Crystal Lattice]] and the
- [[Crystal Basis]]

The Lattice is an infinite set of points determined by a number of Translational symmetries. We impose at each of these [[Lattice Point|Lattice Points]] the [[Crystal Basis]] which 


by the translational symmetries of the structure, often represented through the choice of [[Primitive Lattice Vector|Primitive Lattice Vectors]]. 

With the crystal structure as a whole being distinguished by the [[Crystal Symmetries]] of the combined [[Crystal Lattice]] and [[Crystal Basis]].

> This is done as will be seen later, as the choice of [[Primitive Lattice Vector]], [[Unit Cell|Units Cells]] or [[Crystal Basis]] representation is not unique for a given physical structure.

This is then turned into a physical crystal structure by the addition of the [[Crystal Basis]], which is a microscopic structure which decorates each **lattice point**.

This structure strongly influences the properties of the material.
