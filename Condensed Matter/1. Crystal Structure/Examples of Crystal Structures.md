# [[Simple Cubic Crystal Lattice]]

![[Simple Cubic Slide.pdf]]

This both the name given to the [[Bravais Lattices]] and also the [[Crystal Structure]] when decorated with the single atom [[Crystal Basis|basis]] $(0, 0, 0)$ (this is in fact, the only single atom basis possible, as all others are just translations of this).

### [[Packing Fraction]]
- $V_{\text{cell}} = a^3$
- $r_{\text{atom}} = \frac{R_{nn}}{2} = \frac{a}{2}$.
- N = $4 \times \frac 14$
- $V_{\text{atoms}} = \frac 43 \pi (r_{\text{atom}})^3 \cdot N$
- $\mathrm{PF} = \frac{V_{\text{atoms}}}{V_{\text{cell}}} = \frac{\pi}{6}$

# [[Face Centered Cubic Crystal Lattice]]

![[FCC Slide.pdf]]

This both the name given to the [[Bravais Lattices]] and also the [[Crystal Structure]] when decorated with the single atom [[Crystal Basis|basis]] $(0, 0, 0)$.

This can also be represented as a 4 atom [[Crystal Basis]], 8 $\frac 18$th on the corners, 6 $\frac 12$ves on the faces. We can compute a [[Conventional Unit Cell]] for this [[Crystal Structure]] as,

- The bottom left corner $(0,0,0)$.
- The three faces closest to it, $\(\frac 12,\frac 12, 0\), \(\frac 12, 0, \frac 12\), \(0, \frac 12,\frac 12\)$.

This can also be expressed in the form of a [[Primitive Unit Cell]], as shown below

with [[Primitive Lattice Vector]],

$$
\vec a_1 = \frac{a}{2}(\hat x + \hat y),
\hspace{.5cm}
\vec a_2 = \frac{a}{2}(\hat y + \hat z),
\hspace{.5cm}
\vec a_3 = \frac{a}{2}(\hat x + \hat z).
$$

# [[Body Centered Cubic Crystal Lattice]]

Again, this the name of the [[Crystal Lattice]] and also the [[Crystal Structure]] formed when imposing the [[Unitary Crystal Basis]] $(0,0,0)$.

![[BCC Slide.pdf]]

The [[Conventional Unit Cell]] for this structure is a 2 atom basis ($8 \times \frac 18 \text{ (corner) } + 1 \text{ (inside)}$) imposed on a [[Simple Cubic Crystal Lattice]].

> So for all of these we are expressing a complex crystal lattice, as a basis on a more simple one I think? Right?

# [[Cesium Chloride Crystal Structure]]

This is a [[Crystal Structure]] based on the [[Body Centered Cubic Crystal Lattice]] with a different atom in the body centered position.

![[CsCl CS.pdf]]

This is widely adopted by ionic compounds as the nearest neighbour of any atom is one of the opposite species.

# [[Sodium Chloride Crystal Structure]]

This crystal structure is another frequently adopted by ionic compounds. It can be expressed either as a [[Simple Cubic Crystal Lattice]] with a two atom heterogeneous [[Crystal Basis]] of #todo; or a [[Face Centered Cubic Crystal Lattice]] with a basis $r: (0,0,0), g: (\frac 12, \frac 12, \frac 12)$.

# [[Diamond Crystal Structure]]

> **Programming Note**: Wait have we been talking about [[Crystal Lattice]] or [[Crystal Structure]] for this entire time? I think structures... will need to rename #todo.

![[ZB Diamond Slide.pdf]]

This structure is called the [[Zincblend Crystal Structure]] if the red and green atoms are distinct, the [[Diamond Crystal Structure]] if they are not.
