# Wigner-Seitz Cell

The [[Wigner-Seitz Cell]] is a [[Primitive Unit Cell]] which contains all space which is closer to a given lattice point, than any other.

It is the unique [[Primitive Unit Cell]] which possesses the symmetries of the crystal lattice they comprise. An example is shown below.

Note from Wikipedia:

> For *composite lattices*, (crystals which have more than one vector in their [[Crystal Basis|basis]]) each single lattice point represents multiple atoms.
> 
> We can break apart each Wignerâ€“Seitz cell into subcells by further Voronoi decomposition according to the closest atom, instead of the closest lattice point.

## Method for Construction
1. Pick a [[Lattice Point]].
2. Draw lines to all nearby lattice points.
3. The region enclosed by the perpendicular bisectors (either lines in 2D or planes in 3D) of all these lines in the [[Wigner-Seitz Cell]].
