# Unit Cell

A [[Unit Cell]] is a region of space which can be repeatedly tessellated without gaps to assemble the lattice. These can be used to represent the crystal as a whole, any [[intensive properties]] of the crystal being equal to those of the unit cell (with extensive properties being difficult to reason about due to the "infinite" nature of the lattice, and the sheer size of real crystals with respect to their unit cell).

These are, as with [[Primitive Lattice Vector]], not unique. You can in fact assemble an $n$-dimensional cell by taking the area spanned by any $n$ [[Primitive Lattice Vector]].

## Area

The area of a [[Unit Cell]] is computable from the [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] as so,

- 2D, $\|\vec{a} \cp \vec{b}\|$
- 3D, $a \dp \|\vec{b} \cp \vec{c}\|$

## Varieties

There are three special Unit Cell varieties,

- [[Primitive Unit Cell]]
	- [[Wigner-Seitz Cell]]
- [[Conventional Unit Cell]]
