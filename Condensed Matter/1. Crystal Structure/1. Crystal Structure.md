# Crystal Structure

A Crystal is a solid material who's constituents are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure. It is described by a [[Crystal Structure]] which is itself comprised of the combination of a

- [[Crystal Lattice]]
- [[Crystal Basis]]

these are identified by their [[Crystal Structure#Crystal Symmetries]], leading to the [[Bravais Lattices]] in 2D and 3D. Examples of these include:

- [[Body Centered Cubic Crystal Structure]]
- [[Cesium Chloride Crystal Structure]]
- [[Diamond Crystal Lattice]]
- [[Hexagonal Close Packing Crystal Lattice]]
- [[Sodium Chloride Crystal Structure]]
- [[Zincblend Crystal Structure]]
- [[Oblique Crystal Lattice]]
- [[Simple Cubic Crystal Lattice]]
- [[Face Centered Cubic Crystal Lattice]]
- [[Body Centered Cubic Crystal Lattice]]
- [[Square Crystal Lattice]]
- [[Diamond Crystal Structure]]
- [[Primitive Rectangular Crystal Lattice]]


## Crystal Lattices

We construct these Crystal Lattices out of the integer span of [[Primitive Lattice Vector|Primitive Lattice Vectors]], giving us the [[Lattice Vector|Lattice Vectors]] which identify [[Lattice Point|Lattice Points]] in a given infinite lattice. RTh
