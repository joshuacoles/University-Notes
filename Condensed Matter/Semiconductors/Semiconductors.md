A Semiconductor is a crystal with a [[Band Gap]] of approximately $1\unit{eV}$, known as $E_G$, between its [[Valence Band]] band, the *highest*, **fully occupied** (and thus **inert** band), and its [[Conduction Band]], the *lowest* unoccupied band, which is completely empty.

> Because of these properties a Semiconductor conducts at room temperature, but not $T = 0$. If the gap is $\gg 1eV$ then the chance of excitation is substantially lower and thus the material is an insulator.

There are 2 qualities which we use to classify Semiconductors.

- [[Direct Band Gap Semiconductors]] vs [[Indirect Band Gap Semiconductors]]
- [[Intrinsic Semiconductors]] vs [[Extrinsic semiconductors]].

When working with Semiconductors we take the following assumptions / conventions:

- We generally assume they are [[Direct Band Gap Semiconductors]] **unless stated otherwise**, with this point being at $\vk = 0$.
- We measure energies from the peak of the [[Valence Band]], labeling it $\epsi = 0$.
- We approximate the energies of the states in these bands as parabolic in $\|\vk\|$, cf [[#Energies of Bands]].

## [[Direct Band Gap Semiconductors|Direct]] vs [[Indirect Band Gap Semiconductors|Indirect]]

A [[Direct Band Gap Semiconductor]] has the maxima of the [[Valence Band]] at the same $\vk$ as the minima of the [[ConBand]]
