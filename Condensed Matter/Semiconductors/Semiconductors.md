A Semiconductor is a crystal with a [[Band Gap]] of approximately $1\unit{eV}$ between its [[Conduction Band]], the *lowest* unoccupied band, and its [[Valence Band]] band, the *highest* occupied band. There are 2 qualities which we use to classify Semiconductors.

- [[Direct Band Gap Semiconductors]] vs [[Indirect Band Gap Semiconductors]]
- [[Intrinsic Semiconductors]] vs [[Extrinsic semiconductors]].

When working with Semiconductors we take the following assumptions / conventions:

- We
