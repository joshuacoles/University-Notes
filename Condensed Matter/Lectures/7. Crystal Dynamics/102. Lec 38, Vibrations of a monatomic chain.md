## Atomic Potentials

Real solids are made up of atoms held together by interatomic forces, normally modeled using a [[Lennard-Jones Potential]]. The exact coefficients will differ depending on the solid in question, what bonding is dominant, etc.

However since we are dealing with solids, we will only be dealing with atoms which occupy the region near the minima of the potential curve, circled in the diagram below.

![[Pasted image 20210507205021.png]]

Labeling the position of the minima $r_s$ we Taylor Expand this potential to the second degree at this point,

$$
\begin{align}
V(r)
&= V(r_s) + \frac{\d V}{\d r}_{r_s} (r - r_s) + \frac12 \frac{\d^2 V}{\d r^2}_{r_s} (r - r_s)^2 \\
&= V(r_s) + \frac12K(r - r_s)^2 \\
\end{align}
$$

note that as we are at a minima, $\frac{\d V}{\d r} = 0 \land \frac{\d^2 V}{\d r^2} = K > 0$.

This is our old friend the [[Harmonic Oscillator]], thus corroborating the quote:

> The subject of physics is the progression application of the harmonic oscillator to more and more basic components.

## Lattice Vibrations

For simplicity we start by considering a 1D lattice of lattice constant $a$ giving the equilibrium spacing. Each bond is modeled with a spring, with constant $K$. This setup is shown below.

![[Pasted image 20210507210253.png]]

The displacement of each atom from its original position, $x_s = sa$, is labeled $u_{s + i}$ where $s + i$ is the atom's index, in relation to some chosen atom $s$. 

From these we can employ [[Hooke's Law]] to determine the force exerted by the spring between $s+1$ ans $s$ to be,

$$
F_{s+1} = K(u_{s + 1} - u_{s})
$$

and hence the force on a given atom $s$,

$$
\begin{align}
F
&= F_{s+1} - F_{s} \\
&= K(u_{s + 1} - u_{s}) - K(u_{s} - u_{s - 1}) \\
&= K(u_{s + 1} + u_{s - 1} - 2u_{s})
\end{align}
$$

and the differential equation come recurrence relation (the mathematician in me squeals with joy before crying that we will not actually investigate this further),

$$
M\frac{\d^2 u_{s}}{\d t^2} = K(u_{s + 1} + u_{s - 1} - 2u_{s}).
$$

Although this system is discrete, we can look to the [[101. Lec 37, Introduction to crystal dynamics#Continuum theory of longitudinal vibrations]] for a possible, solution. Aka, a wave solution, 

$$
u_s = u\expp{i(k\dp x_s - \omega t)}
$$

> Note that this is one of those times where we take the $\mathrm{Re}$ component as the physical displacement, using a complex plane wave for convenience.

which substituting in we obtain

$$
\begin{align}
-M \omega^2 \expp{i[k\dp sa - \omega t]} 
&= Ku\Big[
\expp{i[k\dp (s+1)a - \omega t]}  \\
&\phantom{=\;} + \expp{i[k\dp (s-1)a - \omega t]}  \\
&\phantom{=\;} - 2\expp{i[k\dp sa - \omega t]}\Big]
\end{align}
$$

> #todo format that bitch

which gives us,

$$
-M \omega^2 u = 2Ku(\cos(ka )- 1)
$$

and a [[Dispersion Relation]],

$$
\omega^2 = \frac{2K}{M}(1 - \cos(ka)) = \frac{4K}{M}\sin^2\frac{ka}2
$$

giving solutions,

$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{4K}{M}} \left| \sin{\frac{ka}{2}} \right|
$$

From this graph we can observe the following,

- There is a maximum frequency known as the [[Cutoff Frequency]], $\omega_{\'{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{4K}{M}}$.
- The frequency is periodic in the wave vector with a period equal to the [[Brillouin Zone]].

These two features as discussed in more detail below.

### [[Cutoff Frequency]]

As mentioned above there is a maximum angular frequency of [[Lattice Vibrations]] within the crystal of,

$$\omega_{\'{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{4K}{M}}$$

this can be seen clearly in the equation. Attempting to obtain values of $\omega > \omega_{\'{max}}$ can be achieved with complex $k$ OKAY WTF #todo #FR but these decay as they move away from the atom undergoing forced motion, only giving us localised vibrations.

> #FR Okayyyy look at: 
> - Different oscillation types in VWO.
> - Complex solutions to the wave equation

### Periodicity

Further we also see that the allowed angular frequencies are periodic in $k$ with a period corresponding to the [[Brillouin Zone]], an example is shown below.

![[Pasted image 20210507214456.png]]

> This phenomena is known as [Aliasing when Sampling Sinusoidal Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing#Sampling_sinusoidal_functions) and is really quite interesting. #FR

### Speed of Vibrations

In the long wavelength ($g \gg a \iff ka \ll 1$) the [[Dispersion Relation]] [[#^f4f4e0|above]] becomes,

$$
\omega(k) = \sqrt{\frac{4K}{M}} ka
$$

and hence long wavelength lattice vibrations are **dispersionless**, with

$$
v_p = v_g = \sqrt\frac{K}{M} a = \sqrt\frac{E}{\rho}.
$$

hence recovering the [[101. Lec 37, Introduction to crystal dynamics#Continuum theory of longitudinal vibrations|Continuum]] result.

![[Pasted image 20210507215850.png]]

In general we have a relation,

$$
v_g = \frac{\d \omega}{\d k} = \sqrt\frac{Ka^2}{M} \cos\frac{ka}{2}
$$

In addition note that at $k = \pm\frac\pi a$ we have $v_g = 0$ and hence [[Standing Waves]].

### Counting Lattice Vibrations

To compute the number of distinct vibrational states that are present in the material we take a macroscopic sample (thus ignoring edge effects) of length $L = Na$, $N$ being the number of atoms. This forms a [[Periodic Boundary Condition]] (to whoever read this I think the page on this (its pluralised) is to specific for the more general construct #todo).

This this gives us that atoms $s$ and $s + N$ are equivalent. Enforcing this boundary condition we obtain,

$$
\begin{align}
u_{s + N} &= u_s \\
u\expp{i(k(s+N)a - \omega t)} &= u\expp{i(ksa - \omega t)} \\
\expp{ikNa} &= 1 \\
kNa &= n 2\pi \quad n \in \Z
\end{align}
$$

hence the wave vectors are separated by $\Delta k = \frac{2\pi}{Na}$ with a total number of modes equal to,

$$
\frac{\'{Length of Brillouin Zone}}{\'{Spacing of Points}} =
\frac{\frac{2\pi}{a}}{{\frac{2\pi}{Na}}} = N
$$

Thus a monatomic chain supports $N$ different [[Longitudinal Lattice Vibrations]].

### [[Transverse Lattice Vibrations]]

In addition to [[Longitudinal Lattice Vibrations]] the chain also supports two varieties of [[Transverse Lattice Vibrations]], one for each of the two perpendicular dimensions. These two are [[Degenerate]] in this idealised solid, however in real solids they can be different.

Transverse restorative forces are normally weaker than the comparable [[Longitudinal Lattice Vibrations]] and thus lie below said vibrations on a $(\omega,k)$  plot.

![[Pasted image 20210508111726.png]]

In total the chain supports $3N$ distinct lattice vibrations, something we should have expected noting this is the number of degrees of freedom $N$ atoms.

### Application of Model to Real Materials

As mentioned before, though this model is exceptionally simple, it can be used to understand [[Lattice Vibrations]] in monatomic lattices where planes of atoms vibrate. For example in $\ce{Cu}$ which is a [[Face Centered Cubic Crystal Lattice]] we have the following.

![[Pasted image 20210508112045.png]]

Along the first line $\Gamma \to X$ we have a pattern which should be familiar as well we on $\Gamma \to L$ however in $K \to \Gamma$ we see the two [[Transverse Lattice Vibrations]] become **non-degenerate** and separate, the reason this can be seen in the diagrams below.

![[Pasted image 20210508112325.png]]

Transverse vibrations are degenerate for [[Wave Vector|Wave Vectors]] along $\Gamma \to X$ because these correspond to vibrations of the $(100)$ planes, which have $x \leftrightarrow y$ symmetry.

Transverse vibrations along $\Gamma \to K$ are not degenerate, because $(110)$ planes do not have $x \leftrightarrow y$ symmetry.
