- Real solids are made up of atoms held together by iteratomic forces
	- This is a R-J curve potential maybe? 6-12 or 1-10
	- This will differ from solid to solid however dependent on the bonding type.
	- However since we are dealing with solids we will only be dealing with regions surrounding the minima.
	- Hence we $\mathcal{O}((r - r_s)^2)$ it where $r_s$ is the minimum point.
		- Remembering the $r^1$ term is zero, and $r^0$ can be ignored in some cases.
		- $V(r) = V_0 + \frac 12 K(r - r_s)^2$
		- $F(r) = -\frac{\d V}{\d r} = -k(r - r_s)$
		- SPRINGSSSSSSS
		- Harmonic oscillation and all that good shit
		- > the subject of physics is the progression application of the harmonic oscillator to more and more basic components.
