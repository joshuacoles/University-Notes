## Atomic Potentials

Real solids are made up of atoms held together by interatomic forces, normally modeled using a [[Lennard-Jones Potential]]. The exact coefficients will differ depending on the solid in question, what bonding is dominant, etc.

However since we are dealing with solids, we will only be dealing with atoms which occupy the region near the minima of the potential curve, circled in the diagram below.

![[Pasted image 20210507205021.png]]

Labeling the position of the minima $r_s$ we Taylor Expand this potential to the second degree at this point,

$$
\begin{align}
V(r)
&= V(r_s) + \frac{\d V}{\d r}_{r_s} (r - r_s) + \frac12 \frac{\d^2 V}{\d r^2}_{r_s} (r - r_s)^2 \\
&= V(r_s) + \frac12K(r - r_s)^2 \\
\end{align}
$$

note that as we are at a minima, $\frac{\d V}{\d r} = 0 \land \frac{\d^2 V}{\d r^2} = K > 0$.

This is our old friend the [[Harmonic Oscillator]], thus corroborating the quote:

> The subject of physics is the progression application of the harmonic oscillator to more and more basic components.

## Lattice Vibrations

For simplicity we start by considering a 1D lattice of lattice constant $a$ giving the equilibrium spacing. Each bond is modeled with a spring, with constant $K$. This setup is shown below.

![[Pasted image 20210507210253.png]]

The displacement of each atom from its original position, $x_s = sa$, is labeled $u_{s + i}$ where $s + i$ is the atom's index, in relation to some chosen atom $s$. 

From these we can employ [[Hooke's Law]] to determine the force exerted by the spring between $s+1$ ans $s$ to be,

$$
F_{s+1} = K(u_{s + 1} - u_{s})
$$

and hence the force on a given atom $s$,

$$
\begin{align}
F
&= F_{s+1} - F_{s} \\
&= K(u_{s + 1} - u_{s}) - K(u_{s} - u_{s - 1}) \\
&= K(u_{s + 1} + u_{s - 1} - 2u_{s})
\end{align}
$$

and the differential equation come recurrence relation (the mathematician in me squeals with joy before crying that we will not actually investigate this further),

$$
M\frac{\d^2 u_{s}}{\d t^2} = K(u_{s + 1} + u_{s - 1} - 2u_{s}).
$$

Although this system is discrete, we can look to the [[101. Lec 37, Introduction to crystal dynamics#Continuum theory of longitudinal vibrations]] for a possible, solution. Aka, a wave solution, 

$$
u_s = u\expp{i(k\dp x_s - \omega t)}
$$

> Note that this is one of those times where we take the $\mathrm{Re}$ component as the physical displacement, using a complex plane wave for convenience.

which substituting in we obtain

$$
\begin{align}
-M \omega^2 \expp{i[k\dp sa - \omega t]} 
&= Ku\Big[
\expp{i[k\dp (s+1)a - \omega t]}  \\
&\phantom{=\;} + \expp{i[k\dp (s-1)a - \omega t]}  \\
&\phantom{=\;} - 2\expp{i[k\dp sa - \omega t]}\Big]
\end{align}
$$

> #todo format that bitch

which gives us,

$$
-M \omega^2 u = 2Ku(\cos(ka )- 1)
$$

and a [[Dispersion Relation]],

$$
\omega^2 = \frac{2K}{M}(1 - \cos(ka)) = \frac{4K}{M}\sin^2\frac{ka}2
$$

giving solutions,

$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{4K}{M}} \left| \sin{\frac{ka}{2}} \right|
$$

From this graph we can observe the following,

- There is a maximum frequency known as the [[Cutoff Frequency]], $\omega_{\'{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{4K}{M}}$.
- The frequency is periodic in the wave vector with a period equal to the [[Brillouin Zone]].

These two features as discussed in more detail below.

### [[Cutoff Frequency]]

As mentioned above there is a maximum angular frequency of [[Lattice Vibrations]] within the crystal of,

$$\omega_{\'{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{4K}{M}}$$

this can be seen clearly in the equation. Attempting to obtain values of $\omega > \omega_{\'{max}}$ can be achieved with complex $k$ OKAY WTF #todo #FR but these decay as they move away from the atom undergoing forced motion, only giving us localised vibrations.

> #FR Okayyyy look at: 
> - Different oscillation types in VWO.
> - Complex solutions to the wave equation

### Periodicity

Further we also see that the allowed angular frequencies are periodic in $k$ with a period corresponding to the [[Brillouin Zone]], an example is shown below.

![[Pasted image 20210507214456.png]]

> This phenomena is known as [Aliasing when Sampling Sinusoidal Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing#Sampling_sinusoidal_functions) and is really quite interesting. #FR

### Speed of Vibrations

In the long wavelength ($g \gg a \iff ka \ll 1$) the [[Dispersion Relation]] [[#^f4f4e0|above]] becomes,

$$
\omega(k) = \sqrt{\frac{4K}{M}} ka
$$

and hence long wavelength lattice vibrations are **dispersionless**, with

$$
v_p = v_g = \sqrt\frac{K}{M} a = \sqrt\frac{E}{\rho}.
$$

hence recovering the [[101. Lec 37, Introduction to crystal dynamics#Continuum theory of longitudinal vibrations|Continuum]] result.

In addition note that at $\frac$
