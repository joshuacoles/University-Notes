## Atomic Potentials

Real solids are made up of atoms held together by interatomic forces, normally modeled using a [[Lennard-Jones Potential]]. The exact coefficients will differ depending on the solid in question, what bonding is dominant, etc.

However since we are dealing with solids, we will only be dealing with atoms which occupy the region near the minima of the potential curve, circled in the diagram below.

Labeling the position of the minima $r_s$ we Taylor Expand this potential to the second degree at this point,

$$
\begin{align}
V(r)
&= V(r_s) + \frac{\d V}{\d r}_{r_s} (r - r_s) + \frac12 \frac{\d^2 V}{\d r^2}_{r_s} (r - r_s)^2 \\
&= V(r_s) + \frac12K(r - r_s)^2 \\
\end{align}
$$

note that as we are at a minima, $\frac{\d V}{\d r} = 0 \land \frac{\d^2 V}{\d r^2} = K > 0$.

This is our old friend the [[Harmonic Oscillator]], thus corroborating the quote:

> The subject of physics is the progression application of the harmonic oscillator to more and more basic components.

## Lattice Vibrations

For simplicity we start by considering a 1D lattice of lattice constant $a$ giving the equilibrium spacing. Each bond is modeled with a spring, with constant $K$. This setup is shown below.

The displacement of each atom from its original position is labeled $u_{s + i}$ where $s + i$ is the atom's index, in relation to some chosen atom $s$. 

For each atom we can employ [[Hooke's Law]] to detmine the force as,

$$
F = k
$$

- We model each lattice

- Lattice vibrations, Monatomic
	- Periodic array of atoms, parameter $a$.
	- Connected with springs with spring constnat $K$.
	- Displacent of atom is $u_s$ towards atom $s+1$
	- Knock on effects
	- Also extension of the $s-1 \to s$ spring.
	- All atoms move sym
	- EoM
		- Two forces from displacemtn of spring in left and rigth
		- Differential equation *and* recurrance relation, this sounds fun :D
		- However.... since we know about the continum limit we choose a wave like solution
			- $u_s = u\expp{i(kx_s - \omega t)}$
			- Again with the $\Re$eeeeeeee's
	- This gives a Dispersion relation ^3198d0
		- As a consequence of this we end up with a maximum omega [[#^cut-off]]
		- also its periodic in $\vk$ [[#^rok]]
		- Cut off Frequency ^cut-off
			- WHat happens if we try to break this
			- Leads to solutions with complex $\vk$ leading to a thing which decays with distance
				- Okay this is gonna need some work...
		- Range of k ^rok
			- THIS IS TO DO WITH THAT SAMPLING THINGGGYGYGGYYYYYYY
				- Maybe,
			- [[Brillouin Zone]]
		- Speed	Of Sound
			- Should this be under [[#^3198d0]]
			- Group and phase
			- Approx linear in small $\sin x \approx x$.
				- Long $\lambda$
			- What happens at the edges... it goes to zero. Standing wave!!!
	- Counting Lattice vibrations
		- periodic $s \to s + N$
	- Transverse 
		- All of the above was Longitudinal
		- Now trasverse
		- These are degenerate, with some in $x\ or\ y$,
		- Fun cuves
		- $3N$ vibrational modes
	- Application to IRL
		- Planes are like the model we used
		- Icky to plot
		- FCC
