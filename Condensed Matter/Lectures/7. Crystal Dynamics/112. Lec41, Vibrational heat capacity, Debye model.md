## [[Debye model of Vibrational Heat Capacity]]

Whereas the [[Einstein Model of Vibrational Heat Capacity]] assumes that all oscillations are independent the [[Debye model of Vibrational Heat Capacity]] goes one step further accounting for the relationship between [[Lattice Vibrations]] and the different branches in the [[Dispersion Relation]] of a monatomic 1D [[Crystal Lattice]] (with [[Unitary Crystal Basis]]) as discussed in [[102. Lec 38, Vibrations of a monatomic chain|Lec 38]] and shown below.

### Focus on the Long Wavelength

First we need to justify a simplification to our model, the focus on the region of the the [[Dispersion Relation|Dispersion Curve]] with low $\omega$. We do this by considering what we already know about the average energy of a quantum oscillator,

$$
\expt{E_\'{osc}} = \frac{\hbar\omega}{\expp{\hbar\omega\beta} - 1}
$$

we can see that the relative contributions of the different $\omega$ values decreases approximately exponentially as $\omega$ increases, most notably in the low temperature limit where as discussed before this expression becomes,

$$
\expt{E_\'{osc}} = \hbar\omega\expp{-\hbar\omega\beta}.
$$

```

hence we justify the

we sum over all modes of the bands above

$$
\expt{E} = \sum_{(k, \omega_k) \in L, T_1, T_2} \frac{\hbar\omega_k}{\expp{\hbar\omega_k\beta} - 1}
$$



which in the low temperature regime becomes,

$$
\expt{E} = \sum_{(k, \omega_k) \in L, T_1, T_2} \hbar\omega_k\expp{-\hbar\omega_k\beta}.
$$



Further, observing the behaviour of this model across different $\omega_k$, we see that the due to the exponential decay relation, those modes with *small* $\omega_k$ will offer the most affect. Hence we focus on this region, allowing to approximate the dispersion curves above as linear, [[Dispersionless]], relations such that

$$
\omega_k = c_i\omega_k
$$

where $c_i$ is dependent on your chosen branch. Thus expressing our sum now as an integral,

$$
\expt{E} = \int \frac
$$

are oscillating independently of each other, the [[Debye model of Vibrational Heat Capacity]] deals with the [[Lattice Vibrations]] of the crystal which we discussed in [[102. Lec 38, Vibrations of a monatomic chain|Lec 38]] & [[103. Lec 39, Vibrations of a diatomic chain|Lec 39]].

Thus applying our knowledge of the average energy of a quantum oscillator,

$$
\expt{E_\'{osc}} = \frac{\hbar\omega}{\expp{\hbar\omega\beta} - 1}
$$

- D guy model
	- The [[Einstein Model of Vibrational Heat Capacity]] assumes all atoms are oscillating independently
	- But instead we have *lattice* vibrations
		- With a multi value $\omega$ for $k$
	- Start with expression for energy of oscillator of $\omega$ from before.
	-  `vts 2:37` But instead of 3N oscillators...
	-  we have [[Lattice Vibrations]] $\omega(\vk)$ so
	-  $\sum_{k modes} \expt{E_{osc}}$
	-  Low temp ignore $-1$ again
	-  Thus looking at it we see low $\omega$ ones are the most important contribution due to $\exp(-\omega \dots)$.
	-  Hence since we only care about this region, assume $\omega \propto k$ we can evaluate with an integral 
	- `vts 6:52` $$ \int E_osc g(\omega) d\omega$$ 
	- Couting states
