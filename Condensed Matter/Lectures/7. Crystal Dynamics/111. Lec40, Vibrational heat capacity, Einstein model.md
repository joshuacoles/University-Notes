- Classical theory
	- $E = T + U = \frac 12 m x_i^2 + \frac12 k\dot x_i^2$
	- [[Equiparition Principle]], $\frac36k_BT$
	- Heat capacity per mole at constant volume of a material with this property should be $C_V = \p/\p T (<E>/n)_V = 3R \approx 25\unit J$.
		- [[Law of Dulong and Petit]]
	- This is satisfied at higher $T$ but not at low temperature
		- But have anomalies such as diamond.
- Einstein `vts 10:10`
	- Prob dist of $E$
	- Average energy 
	- Parition fn (10:00)
		- Gives average energy
		- why did we do this again?
	- N atoms, so $3N<E_osc>$
	- High Temp `vts 10:20`
		- exp(hbaromega/kbT) => 1 + (hb omega / kBT) #tag
		- Predict [[Law of Dulong and Petit]] at high T
		- 15:30
	- Low temp
		- Assume exp(R/T), R/T >> 1 allows to approx ignore the +1
		- C_V
		- Einstein temperature $\theta_E$
		- Goes to zero at $T \to 0$
		- Summary `vts 21:40`
	- Example for diamond `vts 23:21`
