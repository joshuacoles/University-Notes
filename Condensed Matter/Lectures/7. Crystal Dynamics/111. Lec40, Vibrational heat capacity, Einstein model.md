- Classical theory
	- $E = T + U = \frac 12 m x_i^2 + \frac12 k\dot x_i^2$
	- [[Equiparition Principle]], $\frac36k_BT$
	- Heat capacity per mole at constant volume of a material with this property should be $C_V = \p/\p T (<E>/n)_V = 3R \approx 25\unit J$.
		- [[Law of Dulong and Petit]]
	- This is satisfied at higher $T$ but not at low temperature
		- But have anomalies such as diamond.
- Einstein
	- Prob dist of $E$
	- Average energy 
	- Parition fn (10:00)
		- Gives average energy
		- why did we do this again?
	- N atoms, so $3N<E_osc>$
	- High Temp
		- exp()
