## Classical Theory of Heat Capacity

In the Classical Theory we view each atom has having 3 pairs of springs, one for each dimension. In addition to the kinetic energy this gives,

$$
E = \frac 12 m x_i^2 + \frac12 k\dot x_i^2,\quad i \in \set{1,2,3}
$$

which by the [[Equiparition Principle]] gives an average total energy of,

$$
\langle E \rangle = \frac62 k_BT = 3 k_BT
$$
and thus a molar [[Heat Capacity]] at constant volume of,

$$
c_V = \frac1n \(\frac{\p \langle nN \dp E \rangle}{\p T}\)_V = 3R \approx 25\unit J
$$

this is the empirical [[Law of Dulong and Petit]]. 

This relation is satisfied at higher temperatures but fails to be true at lower temperature or at all for materials such as diamond.

## [[Einstein Model of Vibrational Heat Capacity]]

- Einstein `vts 10:10`
	- Prob dist of $E$
	- Average energy 
	- Parition fn (10:00)
		- Gives average energy
		- why did we do this again?
	- N atoms, so $3N<E_osc>$
	- High Temp `vts 10:20`
		- exp(hbaromega/kbT) => 1 + (hb omega / kBT) #tag
		- Predict [[Law of Dulong and Petit]] at high T
		- 15:30
	- Low temp
		- Assume exp(R/T), R/T >> 1 allows to approx ignore the +1
		- C_V
		- Einstein temperature $\theta_E$
		- Goes to zero at $T \to 0$
		- Summary `vts 21:40`
	- Example for diamond `vts 23:21`
