## Classical Theory of Heat Capacity

In the Classical Theory we view each atom has having 3 pairs of springs, one for each dimension. In addition to the kinetic energy this gives,

$$
E = \frac 12 m x_i^2 + \frac12 k\dot x_i^2,\quad i \in \set{1,2,3}
$$

which by the [[Equiparition Principle]] gives an average total energy of,

$$
\langle E \rangle = \frac62 k_BT = 3 k_BT
$$

per atom and and thus a molar [[Heat Capacity]] at constant volume of,

$$
c_V = \frac1n \(\frac{\p \langle nN_A \dp E \rangle}{\p T}\)_V = 3R \approx 25\unit J
$$

this is the empirical [[Law of Dulong and Petit]]. 

This relation is satisfied at higher temperatures but fails to be true at lower temperature or at all for materials such as diamond.

## [[Einstein Model of Vibrational Heat Capacity]]

Einstein provided a first model of heat capacity in a quantum setting, he postulated that oscillators have quantised energies given by,

$$
E_n = n\hbar \omega
$$

> **Note**: This equation is actually incorrect as it missed the [[Zero Point Motion]] of the oscillators discussed before, instead it should read
> $$
> E_n = \(\frac 12 + n\)\hbar \omega
> $$
> However this is immaterial to the obtained value for the heat capacity.

Combining this with a probability distribution,

$$
P(E = E_n) = \frac 1Z \expp{-E_n \over k_BT}
$$

where $Z$ is the [[Parition Function]] given by,

$$
\begin{align}
Z
&= \sum_{n \in \N_0} \expp{-E_n \over k_BT} \\
&= \sum_{n \in \N_0} \expp{-n\hbar \omega \beta} \\
&= \sum_{n \in \N_0} \(\expp{-\hbar \omega \beta}\)^n \\
&= \frac{1}{1 - \expp{-\hbar \omega \beta}}
\end{align}
$$

> Here we note that the correct $E_n$ value would just give a constant factor and hence a constant sum in $\ln Z$, which disappears under the derivative below.

which with the aim of employing [[Maxwell's Relations]] we take the log,

$$
\begin{align}
\ln Z
&= \ln \frac{1}{1 - \expp{-\hbar \omega \beta}} \\
&= -\ln(1 - \expp{-\hbar \omega \beta}) \\
\end{align}
$$

which leads to,

$$
\begin{align}
\expt{E_{\'{osc}}}

&= -\frac{\p}{\p \beta} \ln Z \\

&= -\frac{\p}{\p \beta} \Big[-\ln(1 - \expp{-\hbar \omega \beta})\Big] \\

&= \frac{\p}{\p \beta} \Big[\ln(1 - \expp{-\hbar \omega \beta})\Big] \\

&=
\frac{1}{1 - \expp{-\hbar \omega \beta}}
\frac{\p}{\p \beta} \Big[1 - \expp{-\hbar \omega \beta}\Big] \\

&=
\frac{1}{1 - \expp{-\hbar \omega \beta}}
\hbar\omega\expp{-\hbar \omega \beta} \\

&= \frac{\hbar\omega}{\expp{\hbar \omega \beta} - 1}
\end{align}
$$

this gives a result for a single atom so given as computed before there are a total of $3N$ modes (cf [[103. Lec 39, Vibrations of a diatomic chain|Lec 39]] & [[102. Lec 38, Vibrations of a monatomic chain|Lec 40]]) we get a total average energy of,

$$
\expt{E} = 3N \expt{E_\'{osc}} = \frac{3N\hbar\omega}{\expp{\hbar \omega \beta} - 1}
$$

we now proceed to approximate this expression in various regimes to see how it compares to theory. 

### High Temperature

At high temperature, $\beta \ll 1$ and hence we can approximate $\exp x \approx (1 + x)$, giving us,

$$
\expt{E}
\approx \frac{3N\hbar\omega}{1 + {\hbar \omega \beta} - 1} 
= \frac{3N\hbar\omega}{\hbar \omega \beta}
= \frac{3N}{\beta}
= 3RTn
$$

reproducing the [[Law of Dulong and Petit]] with a [[Heat Capacity]],

$$
c_v = \frac1n \(\frac{\p\expt{E}}{\p T}\)_V = 3R.
$$

### Low Temperatures

At low temperatures we assume $\hbar \omega \beta \gg 1$ and hence that we can approximate the denominator as,

$$
\expt{E}
\approx \frac{3N\hbar\omega}{\expp{\hbar \omega \beta}}
= 3N\hbar\omega \expp{-\hbar \omega \beta}
$$

giving a heat capacity,

$$
\begin{align}
c_v
&= \frac1n \(\frac{\p\expt{E}}{\p T}\)_V \\
&= \frac{\p}{\p T} 3N_A \hbar\omega \expp{-\hbar \omega \beta} \\
&= 3N_A \hbar\omega \frac{\p}{\p T} \expp{-\hbar \omega \beta} \\
&= 3N_A \hbar\omega \Big[
	\expp{-\hbar \omega \beta} \dp \hbar \omega\beta^2 k_B
\Big] \\
&= 3N_A \hbar\omega \frac{\hbar \omega}{k_BT^2} \expp{-\hbar \omega \beta} \\
\end{align}
$$

which introducing the [[Einstein Temperature]] $\theta_E = \frac{\hbar \omega}{k_B}$ becomes,

$$
c_v = 3 N_A k_B \(\frac{\theta_E}{T}\)^2 \expp{-\theta_E \over T}
$$
