- Diatomic chain
	- Similar model as before
	- Springs
	- Lattice constant $a$ now contains two atom and springs
	- $m$ and $M$
	- displacemtns $u$ and $v$ respectivly
	- leads to two EoMs
	- Leads to couple DiffEqs
	- Leads to a nice long quadratic thingy
	- Leads to two branches of $(\omega, k)$, one similar to previous, and one higher (non zero), with min and max, a gap between and it smooth & periodic.
	- We find eigen values for $k = 0, \pi/a$
		- More generally?
