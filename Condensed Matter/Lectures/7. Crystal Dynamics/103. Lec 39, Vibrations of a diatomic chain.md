## [[Lattice Vibrations]] in a 1D chain with 2 Atom Basis

![[Pasted image 20210508153015.png]]

Whereas before we focused on the [[Unitary Crystal Basis]], now we will consider a basis of the form, $m: [0], M: [\frac 12]$ thus having a repeating pattern as shown above. 

> Note that the position of $M$ within the basis is irrelevant as long as we assume that all displacements are small enough that [[Hooke's Law]] holds true and the force is **only** dependent on the extension (ie we remain within the quadratic region of $V$).





- Diatomic chain
	- Similar model as before
	- Springs
	- Lattice constant $a$ now contains two atom and springs
	- $m$ and $M$
	- displacemtns $u$ and $v$ respectivly
	- leads to two EoMs
	- Leads to couple DiffEqs
	- Leads to a nice long quadratic thingy
	- Leads to two branches of $(\omega, k)$, one similar to previous, and one higher (non zero), with min and max, a gap between and it smooth & periodic.
	- We find eigen values for $k = 0, \pi/a$
		- More generally?
	- Bottom branch is accosict branch (cuz it goes to zero I think)
	- Top branch is the opitical branch, to do with charges being in antiphase.
	- Both of these also have transverse equivalents which are doubly-degenerate in the case of high symmetry
	- 3N acoustic modes, 2N optical moods
	- IRL
		- GaAs
		- Si
			- diatomic but equal
