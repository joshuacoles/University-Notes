## [[Lattice Vibrations]] in a 1D chain with 2 Atom Basis

![[Pasted image 20210508153015.png]]

Whereas before we focused on the [[Unitary Crystal Basis]], now we will consider a basis of the form, $m: [0], M: [\frac 12]$, with [[Lattice Parameter]] $a$, thus having a repeating pattern as shown above. 

> Note that the position of $M$ within the basis is irrelevant as long as we assume that all displacements are small enough that [[Hooke's Law]] holds true and the force is **only** dependent on the **extension**/displacement, not the overall length (ie we remain within the quadratic region of $V$).

> Note also that wlog we assume $M > m$.

Again modeling this with springs between the atoms, labeling each [[Lattice Point]] by index $s + i, i \in \Z$ and the displacement of $m_s$ by $u_s$, and $M_s$ by $v_s$.

Through the same logic seen in [[102. Lec 38, Vibrations of a monatomic chain]] we end up the following coupled recurring differential equations,

$$
\begin{align}
m\frac{\d^2 u_s}{\d t^2} &= K(v_s + v_{s - 1} - 2u_s) \\
M\frac{\d^2 v_s}{\d t^2} &= K(u_{s + 1} + u_s - 2v_s)
\end{align}
$$

which again from the [[Continuum theory of Longitudinal Vibrations]] assuming wave like solutions for them both, we equal $k$ and $\omega$ values, we obtain (with some [workings elided](marginnote3app://note/B880F8F8-38F1-4244-9610-85638948993B) because I'm lazy, literally sub it in),

$$
\begin{align}
-m \omega^2 u &= K \Bigg(
	\Big[1 + \expp{-ika}\Big]v - 2u
\Bigg) \\

-m \omega^2 v &= K \Bigg(
	\Big[1 + \expp{ ika}\Big]u - 2v
\Bigg)
\end{align}
$$

and the matrix system,

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{2K}{m} & -\frac{K}{m}\Big[1 + \expp{-ika}\Big]
\\
- \frac{K}{M}\Big[1 + \expp{ika}\Big] & \frac{2K}{M}
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix}
=
\omega^2 \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix}
$$

which is clearly an Eigen Problem. 

> Now, this is physics, we are lazy and as I write these notes I am a little pressed for time and wanting to try some newly made Chutney for the first time (I just had a sample with cheese brought to me and *OMG*), so I will continue this tradition and leave a general solution, for another time.

### Dispersion Relation

This gives a dispersion relation of...

$$
\omega^2 =
K\(\frac1m  + \frac1M\)
\pm
K\sqrt{

}
$$





- Diatomic chain
	- Similar model as before
	- Springs
	- Lattice constant $a$ now contains two atom and springs
	- $m$ and $M$
	- displacemtns $u$ and $v$ respectivly
	- leads to two EoMs
	- Leads to couple DiffEqs
	- Leads to a nice long quadratic thingy
	- Leads to two branches of $(\omega, k)$, one similar to previous, and one higher (non zero), with min and max, a gap between and it smooth & periodic.
	- We find eigen values for $k = 0, \pi/a$
		- More generally?
	- Bottom branch is accosict branch (cuz it goes to zero I think)
	- Top branch is the opitical branch, to do with charges being in antiphase.
	- Both of these also have transverse equivalents which are doubly-degenerate in the case of high symmetry
	- 3N acoustic modes, 2N optical moods
	- IRL
		- GaAs
		- Si
			- diatomic but equal
