## [[Debye model of Vibrational Heat Capacity]]

Whereas the [[Einstein Model of Vibrational Heat Capacity]] assume all atoms are oscillating with the same $\omega$, we know that in fact the oscillations in a [[Crystal Lattice]] are comprised of quantised [[Lattice Vibrations]] as dissed for the 1D monatomic chain in [[102. Lec 38, Vibrations of a monatomic chain|Lec 38]]. These [[Lattice Vibrations]] are in fact

- Quantised, with $\Delta \vk = \frac{2\pi}{N}$
- Bounded, both in $\vk$ to the [[Brillouin Zone]], and in $\omega$ to their [[Cutoff Frequency]].
- Split into three bands, [[Longitudinal Lattice Vibrations]] and two, in this case degenerate under $x \leftrightarrow y$ symmetry, [[Transverse Lattice Vibrations]].

This situation is displayed on the [[Dispersion Relation|Dispersion Curve]] below.
