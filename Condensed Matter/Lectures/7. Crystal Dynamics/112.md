## [[Debye model of Vibrational Heat Capacity]]

Whereas the [[Einstein Model of Vibrational Heat Capacity]] assume all atoms are oscillating with the same $\omega$, we know that in fact the oscillations in a [[Crystal Lattice]] are comprised of quantised [[Lattice Vibrations]] as dissed for the 1D monatomic chain in [[102. Lec 38, Vibrations of a monatomic chain|Lec 38]]. These [[Lattice Vibrations]] are in fact

- Quantised, with $\Delta \vk = \frac{2\pi}{N}$
- Bounded, both in $\vk$ to the [[Brillouin Zone]], and in $\omega$ to their [[Cutoff Frequency]].
- Split into three bands, [[Longitudinal Lattice Vibrations]] and two, in this case degenerate under $x \leftrightarrow y$ symmetry, [[Transverse Lattice Vibrations]].

This situation is displayed on the [[Dispersion Relation|Dispersion Curve]] below.

To adapt to this more complex model, we employ a [[Density of States]] function $g(\omega)$.

### [[Density of States]] $g(\omega)$

As with other 

- Justify w = ck relation
- the "now compute g(w)" section
- Note that this is only technically valid under the first assumption

### Computing the Heat Capacity

- Note we discard the previous note and Application of above to whole of region up to $\omega$
- Comparison graph
- Long integral of shit
	- Using [[Zero Point Motion]] then showint it doesnt matter

### Comparison

### Limitivng Behavious

### Electron Gas
Is this [[Debye model of Vibrational Heat Capacity]]?
