## Previous models

Our previous models for [[Crystal Structure]] is a theoretical idealisation as it involves knowing the precise values of both the position, and thus the momentum of the atoms at each [[Lattice Point]]. This violates the [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]].

In fact even at $T = 0\unit{K}$ atoms must vibrate around their average locations, possessing a [[Zero Point Motion]].

As $T$ increases vibrations will gain thermal energy, we call this [[Lattice Vibrations]]. Of these we will approximate the matter as a Harmonic phenomena for the most part, modeling the lattice as a lattice of springs.

However we will also study anharmonic effects such as thermal expansion.

## Continuum theory of longitudinal vibrations

As a starting point, point of contrast, and as a useful guide for more complicated atomic level considerations.

Here we see that 1D longitudinal vibrations follow a [[Wave Equation]], 

$$
u_{tt} = \frac E\rho u_{xx}
$$

where $u(x,t)$ is the displacement field, $\rho$ is the mass density and $E$ is the Elastic Modulus. This admits solutions,

$$
u(x, t) = u_0 \cos(kx - \omega t + \phi) 
\quad
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}k
$$

this leads to a [[Phase Velocity]] $v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}$ and a [[Group Wave Velocity]] $v_g = \frac{\p\omega}{\p k} = \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}$. Ie there is no [[Dispersion]].

There are also no restrictions on the values of $\omega$ or $k$.
