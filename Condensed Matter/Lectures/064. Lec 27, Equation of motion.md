## Semiclassical Theory of [[Conductivity]]

The [[Bloch Wave|Bloch States]] extend infinitely throughout the crystal, so to describe the motion of localised crystal electrons we form a [[Wave Packet]] from these [[Bloch Wave|Bloch Waves]], 

$$
\psi(x) = \sum_{k \in [k_0 - \delta k, k_0 + \delta k]} c_k \psi_k(x)
$$

with the spacial localisation leading to a spread in the momentum by the [[Uncertainty Principle]]. In order for this to have a well-defined $k$ we require $\delta k$ to be a small fraction of the [[Brillouin Zone]], implying a spacial extent of a few spacial crystal [[Unit Cell|Unit Cells]].
