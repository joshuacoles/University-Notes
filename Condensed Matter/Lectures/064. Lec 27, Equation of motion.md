## Semiclassical Theory of [[Conductivity]]

The [[Bloch Wave|Bloch States]] extend infinitely throughout the crystal, making them ill-suited for the description of localised electrons. Instead we form a [[Wave Packet]] from these [[Bloch Wave|Bloch Waves]], given the form

$$
\Psi(x) = \sum_{k \in [k_0 - \delta k, k_0 + \delta k]} c_k \psi_k(x)
$$

with the spacial localisation leading to a spread in the momentum by the [[Uncertainty Principle]]. In order for this to have a well-defined $k$ we require $\delta k$ to be a **small fraction** of the [[Brillouin Zone]], implying a spacial extent of a few spacial crystal [[Unit Cell|Unit Cells]].

This allows us to identify each wave packet with the pair $(\vk_0, \delta\vk)$, however often $\delta\vk$ is elided, giving us the identification $\Psi_\vk$.

Modeling these wake packets we can use the [[Time Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation]],

$$
\begin{align}
i\hbar \rp_t \Psi_{\vk}  &= \epsi(\vk) \Psi \\
\int \frac{\d \Psi_\vk}{\Psi_\vk} &= \int \frac 1{i\hbar} \epsi(\vk) \rd t \\
\ln \Psi_\vk &= -i\frac{\epsi(\vk)}{\hbar} t + c \\
\Psi_\vk &= \exp{-i\frac{\epsi(\vk)}{\hbar} t}
\end{align}
$$

giving us an analogue for the traditional angular frequency as $\omega = \frac{\epsi(\vk)}{\hbar}$  and thus a [[Group Wave Velocity]] of,

$$
\vv = \grd_{\'{wrt } \vk} \omega(\vk) = \frac 1\hbar \grd\epsi(\vk)
$$

this is a [[Dispersion]] relation, as the velocity of a wave is dependent on its wave number (hence different waves *"disperse"*). Hence plots of [[Energy bands]] are sometimes called Dispersion Diagrams.

## Equations of Motion

Computing an equation of motion for this system, under an imposed electric field $\E$ we have the following. Firstly this leads to an imposed [[Lorentz Force|force]] of $\F = -e \E$ and a consequential work done, under a small displacement $\delta \vx$ given by

$$
W = \delta \vx \dp \F
$$

which is equal to the change in energy of the electron $\delta\epsi$. Hence considering this to take place over some $\delta t$ we have

$$
\frac{\delta \epsi}{\delta t} = 
\frac{-e \vE \dp \delta \vx}{\delta t}
\quad \implies
\frac{\d\epsi}{\d t} = -e \vE \dp \vv
$$

under $\lim_{\delta \to 0}$. However as a consequence of this change in energy, there will a change in [[Wave Vector]]
, hence with us having $\frac{\d\epsi}{\d t}$ we can express this rate of change as,

$$
\frac{\d \vk}{\d t} = \frac{\d \vk}{\d \epsi} \frac{\d \epsi}{\d t}
$$
