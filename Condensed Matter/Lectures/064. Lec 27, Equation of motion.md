## Semiclassical Theory of [[Conductivity]]

The [[Bloch Wave|Bloch States]] extend infinitely throughout the crystal, making them ill-suited for the description of localised electrons. Instead we form a [[Wave Packet]] from these [[Bloch Wave|Bloch Waves]], given the form

$$
\Psi(x) = \sum_{k \in [k_0 - \delta k, k_0 + \delta k]} c_k \psi_k(x)
$$

with the spacial localisation leading to a spread in the momentum by the [[Uncertainty Principle]]. In order for this to have a well-defined $k$ we require $\delta k$ to be a **small fraction** of the [[Brillouin Zone]], implying a spacial extent of a few spacial crystal [[Unit Cell|Unit Cells]].

This allows us to identify each wave packet with the pair $(\vk_0, \delta\vk)$, however often $\delta\vk$ is elided, giving us the identification $\Psi_\vk$.

Modeling these wake packets we can use the [[Time Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation]],

$$
\begin{align}
i\hbar \rp_t \Psi_{\vk}  &= \epsi(\vk) \Psi \\
\int \frac{\d \Psi_\vk}{\Psi_\vk} &= \int \frac 1{i\hbar} \epsi(\vk) \rd t \\
\ln \Psi_\vk &= -i\frac{\epsi(\vk)}{\hbar} t + c \\
\Psi_\vk &= \exp{-i\frac{\epsi(\vk)}{\hbar} t}
\end{align}
$$

giving us an analogue for the traditional angular frequency as $\omega = \frac{\epsi(\vk)}{\hbar}$  and thus a [[Group Wave Velocity]] of,

$$
\vv = \grd_{\'{wrt } \vk} \omega(\vk) = \frac 1\hbar \grd\epsi(\vk)
$$

this is a [[Dispersion]] relation, as the velocity of a wave is dependent on its wave number (hence different waves *"disperse"*). Hence plots of [[Energy bands]] are sometimes called Dispersion Diagrams.

## Equations of Motion

Computing an equation of motion for this system, under an imposed electric field $\E$ we have the following. Firstly this leads to an imposed [[Lorentz Force|force]] of $\F = -e \E$ and a consequential work done, under a small displacement $\delta \vx$ given by

$$
W = \delta \vx \dp \F
$$

which is equal to the change in energy of the electron $\delta\epsi$. Hence considering this to take place over some $\delta t$ we have

$$
\frac{\delta \epsi}{\delta t} = 
\frac{-e \vE \dp \delta \vx}{\delta t}
\quad \implies
\frac{\d\epsi}{\d t} = -e \vE \dp \vv
$$

under $\lim_{\delta \to 0}$. However as a consequence of this change in energy, there will a change in [[Wave Vector]]
, hence with us having $\frac{\d\epsi}{\d t}$ we can express this rate of change as,

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\d \vk}{\d t} 
&= \frac{\d \vk}{\d \epsi} \frac{\d \epsi}{\d t} \\
&= \frac{\d \vk}{\d \epsi} \(-e \vE \dp \vv\) \\
&= \frac{\d \vk}{\d \epsi} \(-e \vE \dp \frac 1\hbar \grd\epsi(\vk)\) \\
&= \cancel{\frac{\d \vk}{\d \epsi}} \(-e \vE \dp \frac 1\hbar \cancel{\grd\epsi(\vk)}\) \\
&= -e \vE \dp \frac 1\hbar. \\
\end{align*}
$$

Which by the magic of knowing what we want already rearrange to get an expression,

$$
\frac{\d(\hbar\vk)}{\d t} = -e \vE
$$

where we can identify the right as the imposed Force, and hence the quantity $\hbar \vk$ as a quantity which behaves *like* a momentum, this is known as the [[Crystal Momentum]].

We can see this by observing the action of the momentum operator $\opp = -i \hbar \grd_{\vx}$ on a single [[Bloch Wave|Bloch State]] $\psi_{\vk}$,

$$
\begin{align*}
\opp \psi_{\vk}
&= -i\hbar\,\grd_\vx \psi_\vk \\
&= -i\hbar\,\grd (\exp(i\vk \dp \vx) u_\vk(\vx)) \\
&= -i\hbar\,\grd (\exp(i\vk \dp \vx) u_\vk(\vx)) \\
&= -i\hbar\(
	i\vk \dp \exp(i\vk \dp \vx) u_\vk(\vx)
  + \exp(i\vk \dp \vx) \,\grd_{\vx}{u_\vk(\vx)}
\) \\
&=
	\hbar \vk \psi_\vk -
    i \hbar \exp(i\vk \dp \vx) \,\grd_{\vx}{u_\vk(\vx)} \\
\end{align*}
$$

hence it can be seen that [[Bloch Wave|Bloch States]] are **not** [[Eigenstates]] of the [[Momentum Operator]]. This is not surprising as the particle exists in a periodic potential and thus has a varying momentum. Generalising this to the whole [[Lorentz Force]] we have,

$$
\frac{\d(\hbar\vk)}{\d t} = -e (\vE + \vv(\vk) \cp \B)
$$

where $\vv = \frac 1\hbar \grd_\vk\epsi(\vk)$. Note that there is no frictional drag due to the lattice of ions here (as seen in the [[Drude Model]]).

## [[Effective Mass]]

Computing the effective mass, we can compute,

$$
\frac{\d \vv}{\d t} = \frac{\d}{\d t} \(\frac1\hbar \frac{\d \epsi}{\d \vk}\)
$$

which applying the product rule gives us,

$$
\frac{\d \vv}{\d t} =
\frac1\hbar
\frac{\d \(\frac{\d\epsi}{\d\vk}\)}{\d \vk} 
\frac{\d\vk}{\d t}
$$

which subbing in the relation from [[#^ea52be|above]] for an external [[Electric Field]] gives us,

$$
\frac{\d \vv}{\d t} =
\frac1\hbar
\frac{\d^2 \epsi}{\d \vk^2} 
\frac1\hbar(-e\E)
$$

and thus,

$$
-e\E = \frac{\hbar^2}{\frac{\d^2 \epsi}{\d \vk^2} } \frac{\d \vv}{\d t}.
$$

We can note that the RHS as discussed above is the imposed force, and hence the LHS being the acceleration, $\va = \frac{\d \vv}{\d t}$, multiplied by a quantity which we can liken to an [[Effective Mass]], usually denoted $m^*$, often written in reciprocal form to avoid annoying fractions,

$$
m^* = \frac{\hbar^2}{\frac{\d^2 \epsi}{\d \vk^2}}
\qquad
\frac 1{m^*} = \frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{\d^2 \epsi}{\d \vk^2}.
$$

We can plot this against $\vk$ in the [[Brillouin Zone]] as shown below

![[Pasted image 20210421171526.png]]

note that since $m^* \propto \frac1{\frac{\d^2 \epsi}{\d \vk^2}}$ it is at points both **infinite** (when the second derivative is zero) and **negative** when it is negative also.
