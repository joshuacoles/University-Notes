## Semiclassical Theory of [[Conductivity]]

The [[Bloch Wave|Bloch States]] extend infinitely throughout the crystal, making them ill-suited for the description of localised electrons. Instead we form a [[Wave Packet]] from these [[Bloch Wave|Bloch Waves]], given the form

$$
\psi(x) = \sum_{k \in [k_0 - \delta k, k_0 + \delta k]} c_k \psi_k(x)
$$

with the spacial localisation leading to a spread in the momentum by the [[Uncertainty Principle]]. In order for this to have a well-defined $k$ we require $\delta k$ to be a **small fraction** of the [[Brillouin Zone]], implying a spacial extent of a few spacial crystal [[Unit Cell|Unit Cells]].

Modeling the behaviour of these waves, using the [[2.6 Change of variables of Integration|Theorem 2.6]], we can compute,

$$
\begin{align}
i\hbar \,\rp_t \psi = \epsi(\vk) \psi
\end{align}
$$
