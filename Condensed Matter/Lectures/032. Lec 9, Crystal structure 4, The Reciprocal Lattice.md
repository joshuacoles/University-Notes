## [[Laue Conditions]]

As discussed in the [[031. Lec 8, Crystal structure 4, Reciprocal Lattice, Prelude|previous lecture]] the [[Laue Conditions]] state that for constructive diffraction to occur from a crystal [[Unitary Crystal Basis]] crystal structure, we must have, 

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{Q} \dp \vec{a} &= 2\pi h \\
\vec{Q} \dp \vec{b} &= 2\pi k \\
\vec{Q} \dp \vec{c} &= 2\pi l
\end{align*}
$$

where
- $\vec{Q} = e$
- $\vec{a}, \vec{b}, \vec{c}$ are the [[Primitive Lattice Vectors]]
- $h,k,l \in \Z$

For example in a [[Simple Cubic Crystal Lattice]] parameterised by [[Lattice Parameters|Lattice Parameter]] $a$, these lattice vectors are defined as,

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{a} &= a\uvi \\
\vec{b} &= a\uvj \\
\vec{c} &= a\uvk \\
\end{align*}
$$

Thus we can compute the dot products from above,

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{Q} \dp \vec{a} &= Q_x a = 2\pi h \\
\vec{Q} \dp \vec{b} &= Q_x a = 2\pi k \\
\vec{Q} \dp \vec{c} &= Q_x a = 2\pi l
\end{align*}
$$

Thus we can determine that $\vec{Q} = \frac{2\pi}{a}(h, k, l)$. Which we can see ourselves forms again, a [[Simple Cubic Crystal Lattice]], where the [[Lattice Parameters]] are inversely proportional to the [[Lattice Parameters]] of the initial lattice.

We can combine this observation with that previously which gave,

$$
\begin{align*}
\|\vec{Q}\| 
&= 2 \|\vec{k}\| \sin\theta \\
\frac{2\pi}{a}\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2} &= 2 \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \sin\theta \\

\frac{1}{a}\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2} &= 2 \frac{1}{\lambda} \sin\theta \\

{h^2 + k^2 + l^2} &= \frac{4a^2}{\lambda^2} \sin^2\theta \\

\sin^2\theta &= \frac{\lambda^2}{4a^2} (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)
\end{align*}
$$

Thus providing a theoretical derivation for the equation we derived in [[023. Lec 5, Crystal Structure 3, Worked example]].

## [[Reciprocal Lattice]]

The values of $\vec{Q}$ which satisfy the [[Laue Conditions]] form a lattice called the [[Reciprocal Lattice]], with lattice vectors denoted $\vec{G}_{hkl}$. These points are generated by the [[Primitive Reciprocal Lattice Vectors]] $\vec{A}, \vec{B}, \vec{C}$,

$$
\vec{G}_{hkl} = h\vec{A} + k\vec{B} + l\vec{C}.
$$

These [[Primitive Reciprocal Lattice Vectors]] can be computed from the [[Primitive Lattice Vectors]] by,

> #cf: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_lattice#Three_dimensions

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec {b}_{1} &={\frac {2\pi }{V}}\ \vec {a} _{2}\times \vec {a} _{3}\\\vec {b} _{2}&={\frac {2\pi }{V}}\ \vec {a} _{3}\times \vec {a} _{1}\\\vec {b} _{3}&={\frac {2\pi }{V}}\ \vec {a} _{1}\times \vec {a} _{2}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\vec{b}_i$ are the [[Primitive Reciprocal Lattice Vectors]] and $\vec{a}_i$ are the [[Primitive Lattice Vectors]], and $V$ is the volume of their span, given by $V = \vec{a} \dp (\vec{b}\cp\vec{c})$.

Note that these have units of reciprocal distance. Multiplying these vectors by $\hbar$ gives momentum.

## The [[Brillouin Zone]]

The [[Wigner-Seitz Cell]] of the [[Reciprocal Lattice]] is called the [[Brillouin Zone]] and can be used to understand diffraction.

From the [[Laue Conditions]], diffraction occurs if $\vec{Q} \in \mathrm{span}\set{\vec{A}, \vec{B}, \vec{C}} = G_{hkl}$ for some $h,k,l \in \Z$. This is equivalent to,

$$
\vec{k} \dp \vec{G} = \frac 12 \|\vec{G}\|^2,
$$

which is another statement for diffraction.

![[Pasted image 20210310200541.png]]

Thus diffraction occurs when $\vec{k}$ terminates on the surface of the [[Brillouin Zone]].

Electrons are also waves and thus we might expect important diffraction effects when they have [[Wave Vector|Wave Vectors]] terminating near the surfaces of the [[Brillouin Zone]].
