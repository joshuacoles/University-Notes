## [[Bloch's Theorem]]

[[Bloch's Theorem]] involves the form of the [[Wave Function]] when we re-introduce the [[Crystal Structure]], as opposed to simply ignoring it. The potential of a crystal will be the sum of the [[Electrostatic potential|Electrostatic Potentials]] of all the ions in the [[Crystal Structure]] and is thus a [[Periodic Potential]].

Whereas before (in the [[Drude Model]] and in [[Sommerfeld Theory]]) we have taken the potential to be the *average* of its actual value[^1], and by the potential's independence of actual value, we choose this to be $V(x) = 0$.

[^1]:  Accounting for the discontinuities at the ions themselves, *we're physicists here after all*.

### 1D Case Simplification

Moving to a more accurate model of crystal behaviour, we need to take into account of this [[Periodic Potential]]. Considering a simplified 1D case, a series of ions (a nucleus surrounded by the tightly bound [[Core Electrons]]) with [[Primitive Lattice Vector|Primitive Lattice Vector]] $\va = a\uvi \in \R$, each with a potential given by [[Coloumb's Law]].

If we start with the case of a [[Plane Wave]] as assumed by the [[Sommerfeld Theory]],

$$
\psi_k(x) = C\exp(ikx)
$$

where $k$ is the [[Wave Vector]]. If we then "turn on" the periodic potential, this [[Plane Wave]] will under-go a series of [[Diffraction]] events, each time changing by succeeding [[Reciprocal Lattice Vectors]],

$$
\psi_k(x) = C_0\exp(ikx) + C_1\exp(ix(k + G_1)) + C_2\exp(ix(k + G_2)) + \cdots
$$

where $C_n$ are constants (determined by the strength of the [[Diffraction]]) and $G_n$ are the vectors $G_n = \frac{2\pi}{a}n$. Performing some simplifications we obtain,

$$
\begin{align*}
\psi_k(x)
&= C_0\exp(ikx) + C_1\exp(ix(k + G_1)) + C_2\exp(ix(k + G_2)) + \cdots \\

&= \sum_n C_n\exp(ix(k+G_n)) \\
&= \sum_n C_n\exp(ikx)\exp(iG_nx) \\
&= \exp(ikx) \sum_n C_n\exp(iG_nx) \\
\end{align*}
$$

where we can label the sum to be, $U_k(x)= \sum_h C_h\exp(iG_hx)$. This sum is periodic in the position argument, with a period of the [[Primitive Lattice Vector|Primitive Lattice Vectors]], in this case $\va = a\uvi$.

$$
U(x + a) = U(x)
$$

This is known as a [[Bloch Wave]].

### [[Bloch Wave|Bloch Waves]] in 3D

Extending this result to 3D we have,

$$
\psi_\vk(\r) = \exp\(i\(\r \dp \vk\)\) U_\vk(\r)
$$

and,

$$
U_\vk(\r) = \sum_{\vG \in \vG_{hkl}} C_{\vG} \exp\(i\(\r \dp \vG\)\)
$$

which is again periodic [[Lattice Vector|Lattice Vectors]] with a period of the [[Primitive Lattice Vector|Primitive Lattice Vectors]],

$$U_\vk(\r) = U_\vk(\r + \vec{R})$$

derived from the [[Laue Conditions]] where $\vG_{hkl}$ are defined by their relation of $\vR \dp \vG_{hkl} = 2\pi(h + k+l)$ and hence $\exp(i\vR\dp\vG_{hkl}) = 1$.

> Note that the coefficients $C_{\vG}$ are bound to the **summation variable**.

### [[Wave Vector]] Periodicity of [[Bloch Wave]]

If evaluate the [[Wave Function]] of a [[Bloch Wave]] at $\vk' = \vk + \vG_{abc}$ where $\vG_{abc} \in \vG_{hkl}$, we observe the following (moving to proper argument notation),

$$
\begin{align*}
\psi(\vk + \vG_{abc}, \r)
&= \sum_{hkl} C_{\vk + \vG_{abc} + \vG_{hkl}} \exp(ix(\vk + \vG_{abc} + \vG_{hkl})) \\
&= \sum_{hkl} C_{\vk + \vG_{(abc) + (hkl)}} \exp(ix(\vk + \vG_{(abc) + (hkl)})) \\
&= \sum_{fgh} C_{\vk + \vG_{fgh}} \exp(ix(\vk + \vG_{fgh})) \\
\end{align*}
$$

where the 2nd to last step is done by noting that $G_{ijk}$ is linear over (with scalars $\Z$) by its construction and the last step a noting that $\Z^3$ is invariant under linear operations.

Obtaining another [[Bloch Wave]]. This shows us that the [[Wave Function]] is periodic in the [[Wave Vector]] with a period of the [[Primitive Reciprocal Lattice Vectors]] (length $A_i = \frac{2\pi}{a_i}$).

This means than all [[Wave Vector|Wave Vectors]] (which are a measurable quantity) exist within the [[Brillouin Zone]], its size determined by the length of the [[Primitive Reciprocal Lattice Vectors]] and thus the [[Lattice Parameter|Lattice Parameters]]. All states with [[Wave Vector|Wave Vectors]] outside the [[Brillouin Zone]] are equivalent to a state within it, where this [[Wave Vector]] is called the [[Reduced Wave Vector]], having the same energy.

The number of [[Wave Vector|Wave Vectors]] within the [[Brillouin Zone]] is its width $\frac{2\pi}{a}$, where $a$ is the [[Lattice Parameter]], divided by the period of the points $\frac{2\pi}L$, where $L$ is the **macroscopic dimension of the crystal**, hence,

$$
n_{\'{wv}} = \frac{\'{width of zone}}{\'{period of points}} = \frac{\frac{2\pi}{a}}{\frac{2\pi}{L}} = \frac{L}{a}.
$$

This is a *very very* large number, which means we will often approximate curves of discrete allowable wave vectors by the continuous curve they trace.

> **Programming Note**: I believe this means we **are not** applying [[Periodic Boundary Conditions]] to this situation??
