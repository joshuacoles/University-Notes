## [[Bloch's Theorem]]

[[Bloch's Theorem]] involves the form of the [[Wave Function]] when we re-introduce the [[Crystal Structure]], as opposed to simply ignoring it. The potential of a crystal will be the sum of the [[Electrostatic potential|Electrostatic Potentials]] of all the ions in the [[Crystal Structure]] and is thus a [[Periodic Potential]].

Whereas before (in the [[Drude Model]] and in [[Sommerfeld Theory]]) we have taken the potential to be the *average* of its actual value[^1], and by the potential's independence of actual value, we choose this to be $V(x) = 0$.

[^1]:  Accounting for the discontinuities at the ions themselves, *we're physicists here after all*.

### 1D Case Simplification

Moving to a more accurate model of crystal behaviour, we need to take into account of this [[Periodic Potential]]. Considering a simplified 1D case, a series of ions () with [[Primitive Lattice Vectors|Primitive Lattice Vector]] $\va = a\uvi$, each with a potential given by [[Coloumb's Law]].

If we start with the case of a [[Plane Wave]] as assumed by the [[Sommerfeld Theory]],

$$
\psi_k(x) = C\exp(ikx)
$$

and then consider at
