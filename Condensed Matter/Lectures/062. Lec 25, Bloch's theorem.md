## [[Bloch's Theorem]]

[[Bloch's Theorem]] involves the form of the [[Wave Function]] when we re-introduce the [[Crystal Structure]], as opposed to simply ignoring it. The potential of a crystal will be the sum of the [[Electrostatic potential|Electrostatic Potentials]] of all the ions in the [[Crystal Structure]] and is thus a [[Periodic Potential]].

Whereas before (in the [[Drude Model]] and in [[Sommerfeld Theory]]) we have taken the potential to be the *average* of its actual value[^1], and by the potential's independence of actual value, we choose this to be $V(x) = 0$.

[^1]:  Accounting for the discontinuities at the ions themselves, *we're physicists here after all*.

### 1D Case Simplification

Moving to a more accurate model of crystal behaviour, we need to take into account of this [[Periodic Potential]]. Considering a simplified 1D case, a series of ions (a nucleus surrounded by the tightly bound [[Core Electrons]]) with [[Primitive Lattice Vectors|Primitive Lattice Vector]] $\va = a\uvi$, each with a potential given by [[Coloumb's Law]].

If we start with the case of a [[Plane Wave]] as assumed by the [[Sommerfeld Theory]],

$$
\psi_k(x) = C\exp(ikx)
$$

and then consider it to have a series of diffraction components, each with a [[Wave Vector]] (in this case wave-number) changed by succeeding [[Reciprocal Lattice Vectors]] (cf [[032. Lec 9, Crystal structure 4, The Reciprocal Lattice]]), given as the sum,

$$
\psi_k(x) = C_0\exp(ikx) + C_1\exp(ix(k + G_1)) + C_2\exp(ix(k + G_2)) + \cdots
$$

where $C_n$ are constants and $G_n$ are the vectors $G_n = \frac{2\pi}{a}n$. Performing some simplifications we obtain,

$$
\begin{align*}
\psi_k(x)
&= C_0\exp(ikx) + C_1\exp(ix(k + G_1)) + C_2\exp(ix(k + G_2)) + \cdots \\

&= \sum_n C_n\exp(ix(k+G_n)) \\
&= \sum_n C_n\exp(ikx)\exp(iG_nx) \\
&= \exp(ikx) \sum_n C_n\exp(iG_nx) \\
\end{align*}
$$

where we can label the sum to be, $U_k(x)= \sum_n C_n\exp(iG_nx)$ which is a function periodic over
