## [[Bloch's Theorem]]

[[Bloch's Theorem]] involves the form of the [[Wave Function]] when we re-introduce the [[Crystal Structure]], as opposed to simply ignoring it. The potential of a crystal will be the sum of the [[Electrostatic potential|Electrostatic Potentials]] of all

Starting with a simplified 1D case, we consider a series of points separated by vector $\va = a \uvi$,
