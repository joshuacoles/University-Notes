## [[Bloch's Theorem]]

[[Bloch's Theorem]] involves the form of the [[Wave Function]] when we re-introduce the [[Crystal Structure]], as opposed to simply ignoring it. The potential of a crystal will be the sum of the [[Electrostatic potential|Electrostatic Potentials]] of all the ions in the [[Crystal Structure]] and is thus a [[Periodic Potential]].

Whereas before (in the [[Drude Model]] and in [[Sommerfeld Theory]]) we have taken the potential to be the *average* of its actual value[^1], and by the potential's independence of actual value, we choose this to be $V(x) = 0$.

[^1]:  Accounting for the discontinuities at the ions themselves, *we're physicists here after all*.

### 1D Case Simplification

Moving to a more accurate model of crystal behaviour, we need to take into account of this [[Periodic Potential]]. Considering a simplified 1D case, a series of ions (a nucleus surrounded by the tightly bound [[Core Electrons]]) with [[Primitive Lattice Vectors|Primitive Lattice Vector]] $\va = a\uvi$, each with a potential given by [[Coloumb's Law]].

If we start with the case of a [[Plane Wave]] as assumed by the [[Sommerfeld Theory]],

$$
\psi_k(x) = C\exp(ikx)
$$

and then consider it to have a series of diffraction components, each with a [[Wave Vector]] (in this case wave-number) changed by succeeding [[Reciprocal Lattice Vectors]] (cf [[032. Lec 9, Crystal structure 4, The Reciprocal Lattice]]), given as the sum,

$$
\psi_k(x) = C_0\exp(ikx) + C_1\exp(ix(k + G_1)) + C_2\exp(ix(k + G_2)) + \cdots
$$

where $C_n$ are constants and $G_n$ are the vectors $G_n = \frac{2\pi}{a}n$. Performing some simplifications we obtain,

$$
\begin{align*}
\psi_k(x)
&= C_0\exp(ikx) + C_1\exp(ix(k + G_1)) + C_2\exp(ix(k + G_2)) + \cdots \\

&= \sum_n C_n\exp(ix(k+G_n)) \\
&= \sum_n C_n\exp(ikx)\exp(iG_nx) \\
&= \exp(ikx) \sum_n C_n\exp(iG_nx) \\
\end{align*}
$$

where we can label the sum to be, $U_k(x)= \sum_n C_n\exp(iG_nx)$ which is a function periodic in $a$ the lattice parameter. This is known as a [[Bloch Wave]].

### [[Bloch Wave|Bloch Waves]] in 3D

Extending this result to 3D we have,

$$
\psi_\vk(\r) = \exp\(i\(\r \dp \vk\)\) U_\vk(\r)
$$

and,

$$
U_\vk(\r) = \sum_{\vQ \in G_{hkl}} C_{\vQ} \exp\(i\(\r \dp \vQ\)\)
$$

which is again periodic [[Lattice Vector|Lattice Vectors]] with a period of the [[Primitive Lattice Vectors]], ie: $U_\vk(\r) = U_\vk(\r + \vec{R})$.

### [[Wave Vector]] Periodicity of [[Bloch Wave]]

If evaluate the [[Wave Function]] of a [[Bloch Wave]] at $\vk' = \vk + \vQ$ where $\vG_{abc} \in \vG_{hkl}$, we observe the following (moving to proper argument notation),

$$
\begin{align*}
\psi(\vk + \vG_{abc}, \r)
&= \sum_{hkl} C_n \exp(ix(\vk + \vG_{abc} + \vG_{hkl})) \\
&= \sum_{hkl} C_n \exp(ix(\vk + \vG_{(abc) + (hkl)})) \\
&= \sum_{fgh} C_n \exp(ix(\vk + \vG_{fgh})) \\
\end{align*}
$$

where the 2nd to last step is done by noting that $G_{ijk}$ is linear over (with scalars $\Z$) by its construction and the last step a noting that $\Z^3$ is invariant under linear operations. Hence this being the same form, we see a [[Bloch Wave]] is periodic in the [[Wave Vector]] with a period of the [[Reciprocal Lattice Vectors]].
