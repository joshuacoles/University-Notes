## [[Bloch's Theorem]]

[[Bloch's Theorem]] involves the form of the [[Wave Function]] when we re-introduce the [[Crystal Structure]], as opposed to simply ignoring it. The potential of a crystal will be the sum of the [[Electrostatic potential|Electrostatic Potentials]] of all the ions in the [[Crystal Structure]], before now (in the [[Drude Model]] and in [[Sommerfeld Theory]]) we have taken the potential to be the *average* of its actual value (accounting for the discontinuities at the ions themselves, *we're physicists here after all*), and by the potential's independence of actual value, we choose this to be $V(x) = 0$. 

Starting with a simplified 1D case, we consider a series of points separated by vector $\va = a \uvi$,
