## Computation of Crystal Properties in [[Sommerfeld Theory]]

The representation of states as seen in [[051. Lec 18, Electrons in solids, The Sommerfeld model#Lattice of Quantised Wave Vectors Fermi Sphere]] is useful however due to the large number of electrons in a crystal there are typically $\approx 10^{23}$ electron states in a $1~\mathrm{cm^3}$  crystal. This poses obvious computational challenges.

Instead we parametrise these states in terms of their energy $\epsi$, transforming the sum of some property $f(\vk)$,

$$
\sum_{\vk} f(\vk)
$$

to,

$$
\int f(\epsi) g(\epsi) f(\epsi) \d \epsi
$$

where:

- $f(\epsi)$ is the property $f(\vk)$ re-expressed in terms of energy, $\epsi = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$.
- $g(\epsi)$ is the [[Density of States]].
- $f(\epsi)$ is the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]]

## [[Density of States]]

The [[Density of States]] $g(\epsi)$ is the number of electron states per unit energy (ie. $g(\epsi) = \frac{\d N}{\d \epsi}$ where $N$ is the number of states up to energy $\epsi$).

Hence the number of states in the range $[\epsi, \epsi + \d \epsi]$ is given as, $N(\epsi + \d\epsi) - N(\epsi) \approx g(\epsi)\d\epsi$.

This is obtainable simply from an expression for $N$, #todo.

Thus giving us,

$$
\begin{align*}
g(\epsi) &\propto \sqrt\epsi \\\\
g(\epsi) &= \frac{V}{2\pi^2} \(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\)^{\frac32}\sqrt\epsi
\end{align*}
$$

where this prefactor is labeled $\alpha = \frac{V}{2\pi^2} \(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\)^{\frac32}$.

### Occupied States

The expression $f(\epsi)g(\epsi)$ gives us an expression for the number of **occupied** states ($f(\epsi)$ being the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]]) at $\epsi$.

Note that the integral,

$$
\int_0^\infty g(\epsi)f(\epsi) \d \epsi = N ~~\Forall T.
$$

> Often we will consider these integrals at $T = 0$ where $f(\epsi)$ is a step-down function at $\epsi_F$, hence restricting the domain to $[0, \epsi_F]$.

### Application: Fermi Energy

Applying this, at $T = 0$ we have,

$$
\begin{align*}
N 
&= \int_0^\infty g(\epsi)f(\epsi) \d \epsi \\
&= \int_0^{\epsi_F} \alpha\sqrt\epsi \cdot 1  \,\d \epsi \\
&= \alpha \left[\frac23 \epsi^{\frac32}\right]_0^{\epsi_F} \\
N &= \frac23 \alpha \epsi_F^{\frac32}
\end{align*}
$$

This gives us, $N \propto V$ and also an expression for $\epsi_F$ in terms of $n$ (which can be determined from the [[Crystal Structure]] and [[Valence Electrons|valence]]),

$$
\begin{align*}
\epsi_F
&=
	\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
	\(\frac{3\pi^2 N}{V}\)^{\frac23} \\
&=
	\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
	(3\pi^2 n)^{\frac23}
\end{align*}
$$

### Application: Total Energy

Applying the logic from above, working out the total energy is an application of $h(\epsi) = \epsi$ and hence at $T = 0$,

$$
\begin{align*}
U_0
&= \int_0^{\epsi_F} \epsi g(\epsi)\\
&= \int_0^{\epsi_F} \alpha \epsi^{\frac32}\\
&= \left[\frac25\alpha \epsi^{\frac52}\right]_0^{\epsi_F}\\

U_0 
&= \frac25\alpha \epsi_F^{\frac52}
\end{align*}
$$

which we can also express as $U_0 = \frac 35 N\epsi_F$ as $N = \frac 23 \alpha \epsi_F^{\frac32}$ from above. 

This is kinetic energy (we are dealing with a gas), and thus we can obtain an average kinetic energy per electron of,

$$
\langle E \rangle = \frac{U_0}{N} = \frac 35 \epsi_F
$$

aka $60\%$ of the maximum kinetic energy.


#### Contrast to the [[Drude Model]]

In the classical [[Drude Model]] kinetic energy is given by the [[Equiparition Principle]] and thus has values ranging from,

- $T=0, v_{av} = 0$
- $T = 300~\mathrm{K}, v_{ax} = 10^7~\mathrm{cm.s^{-1}}$.

In comparison at $T = 0$ the [[Quantum Free Electron Gas]] has a speed of $v_{av} = \sqrt{\frac35} v_F \approx 10^8~ \mathrm{cm.s^{-1}}$. A value much more inline with the values observed in experiment, fixing one of the issues identified in the [[047. Lec 17, Drude model, Assessment#Assessment of the Drude Model]]. This value is $10\times$ greater than the value of the classical electron gas even at room temperature.
