The representation of states as seen in [[051. Lec 18, Electrons in solids, The Sommerfeld model#Lattice of Quantised Wave Vectors Fermi Sphere]] is useful however due to the large number of electrons in a crystal there are typically $\approx 10^{23}$ electron states in a $1~\mathrm{cm^3}$  crystal. This poses obvious computational challenges.

Instead we parametrise these states in terms of their energy $\epsi$, transforming the sum of some property $f(\vk)$,

$$
\sum_{\vk} f(\vk)
$$

to,

$$
\int f(\epsi) g(\epsi) f(\epsi) \d \epsi
$$

where:

- $f(\epsi)$ is the property $f(\vk)$ re-expressed in terms of energy, $\epsi = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$.
- $g(\epsi)$ is the [[Density of States]].
- $f(\epsi)$ is the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]]

> ###### Aside: [[Density of States]]
> - The [[Density of States]] $g(\epsi)$ is the number of electron states per unit energy (ie. $g(\epsi) = \frac{\d N}{\d \epsi}$ where $N$ is the number of states up to energy $\epsi$).
> - Hence the number of states in the range $[\epsi, \epsi + \d \epsi]$ is given as, $N(\epsi + \d\epsi) - N(\epsi) \approx g(\epsi)\d\epsi$.
