## Thermal Conduction

> #programming-note rework this bit

Imagine a cold metal rod at a uniform temperature. Heat one end and then remove it from the heat source, displayed schematically below:

This leads to a thermal imbalance and thus heat flow.

In a second example, consider the same cold rod, but bridging two [[Thermal Reservoirs]] at $T_H$ and $T_C$. Once this system has reached [[Steady State]] there will be a constant temperature gradient and it will undergo uniform heat flow.

Experimentally we can observe that the rate of heat flow $\vq$ is proportional to the temperature gradient,

$$
\vq = -\kappa \nab T
$$

where $\kappa$ is the [[Thermal Conductivity]], a material property. This is [[Fourierâ€™s Law]].

## [[Wiedemann-Franz Law]]

An empirical law stating that the ratio of the [[Thermal Conductivity]] to the [[Conductivity|Electrical Conductivity]] of a material is broadly constant across materials for a given temperature, given by.

$$
\frac{\kappa}{\sigma} = \mathcal{L} T
$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is the *[[Lorenz Number]]*.

## [[Thermal Conductivity]] in the [[Drude Model]]

![[Pasted image 20210329191850.png]]

Considering the metal rod described before (reproduced above), take a point $P$  in body of the rod with $x$ position $x_P$ (the hot end being $x=0$, the cold $x=L$, and thus heat flowing positive $x$ direction, temperature decreasing in the same).

Particles transiting through the point $P$ will come from both directions, however they will not transit [[Isotrophic|isotropically]] due to the temperature gradient at the point. Those particles with the a velocity going from hot to cold will have a greater velocity than those travelling in the opposite direction. This leads to a net energy flow across point $P$ in the form of this kinetic energy, aka a *heat flow*.

Quantifying this we take the following assumptions,

- $E = E(T)$ and $E \sim \mathcal{O}(T)$
- $T = T(x)$ and $T \sim \mathcal{O}(x)$
- On average a particle transiting across $P$ will have done so from a position $\pm v_x\tau$ along the rod.

Thus, considering the number of electrons passing through $P$ per second in either direction is $\frac 12 n v_x$, we can compute the following (focusing on the 1D case),

$$
\begin{align*}
q_{L \to R} &= \frac12 nv_x E(T(x - v_x\tau)) \\
q_{R \to L} &= \frac12 nv_x E(T(x + v_x\tau)) \\\\

q
&= q_{L \to R} - q_{R \to L} \\
&= \frac12 nv_x \(E(T(x - v_x\tau)) - E(T(x + v_x\tau))\).
\end{align*}
$$

Hence applying a [[Taylor Expansion]] to $\mathcal{O}^1$, we get,

$$
\begin{align*}
T(x \pm v_x\tau) &= T(x) \pm v_x\tau \frac{\d T}{\d x} \\
E\(T(x) \pm v_x\tau \frac{\d T}{\d x}\)
&=
E(T(x)) \pm 
	\(T(x) \pm v_x\tau \frac{\d T}{\d x}\)
	\frac{\d E}{\d T}.
\end{align*}
$$

Which gives us,

$$
q = -nv_x^2 \tau \frac{\d T}{\d x}\frac{\d E}{\d T}.
$$

We can generalise this to 3D by considering,

- $\langle v_i^2 \rangle = \langle v_j^2 \rangle ~~\Forall i,j \implies \langle v_x^2 \rangle = \frac 13 \langle \|\vv\|^2 \rangle$.
- $n\frac{\d E}{\d T} = \frac 1V \frac{\d (EN)}{\d T} = c_v$, ie the volumetric specific heat capacity at constant volume. 

Thus giving us

$$
\vq = -\frac13 \langle v^2 \rangle \tau c_V \nab T
$$

from which we can identify the [[Thermal conductivity]] $\kappa$ as

$$
\kappa = \frac13 \langle v^2 \rangle \tau c_V
$$

### Consistency with the [[Wiedemann-Franz Law]]

This, combined with the value of the [[Conductivity|Electrical Conductivity]] we obtained in [[043. Lec 13, Drude model, DC conductivity]], allows us to work out the [[Lorenz Number]] and the theory's compliance with the [[Wiedemann-Franz Law]],

![[043. Lec 13, Drude model, DC conductivity#^conductivity]]

Gives,

$$
\frac \kappa \sigma = \frac 32 \(\frac{k_B^2}{e^2}\)T
$$

and thus $\mathcal{L}$,

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac 32 \(\frac{k_B^2}{e^2}\),
$$

which is consistent with the [[Wiedemann-Franz Law]] in that it is independent of material properties. However when we compute this value it is observed to be $\mathcal{L} \approx 1.11 \times 10^8~\mathrm{W.\Omega.K^{-2}}$, about half the value needed.

```note
This was not noticed by Drude when he first computed this value as he missed a factor of one half in his calculations, thus getting a value which seemed consistent with the Wiedemann-Franz Law.
