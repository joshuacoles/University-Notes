## Thermal Conduction

> #programming-note rework this bit

Imagine a cold metal rod at a uniform temperature. Heat one end and then remove it from the heat source, displayed schematically below:

This leads to a thermal imbalance and thus heat flow.

In a second example, consider the same cold rod, but bridging two [[Thermal Reservoirs]] at $T_H$ and $T_C$. Once this system has reached [[Steady State]] there will be a constant temperature gradient and it will undergo uniform heat flow.

Experimentally we can observe that the rate of heat flow $\vq$ is proportional to the temperature gradient,

$$
\vq = -\kappa \nab T
$$

where $\kappa$ is the [[Thermal Conductivity]], a material property. This is [[Fourierâ€™s Law]].

## [[Wiedemann-Franz Law]]

An empirical law stating that the ratio of the [[Thermal Conductivity]] to the [[Conductivity|Electrical Conductivity]] of a material is broadly constant across materials for a given temperature, given by.

$$
\frac{\kappa}{\sigma} = \mathcal{L} T
$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is the *Lorenz number*.

## [[Thermal Conductivity]] in the [[Drude Model]]

Considering the metal rod described before (reproduced above), take a point $P$  in body of the rod with $x$ position $x_P$ (the hot end being $x=0$, the cold $x=L$, and thus heat flowing positive $x$ direction, temperature decreasing in the same).

Particles transiting through the point $P$ will come from both directions, however they will not transit isotropically
