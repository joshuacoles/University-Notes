# [[Drude Model]]

The [[Drude Model]] is a simple theory of the metallic state and provides a vocabulary and starting point for more correct theories.

We will cover the basic assumptions of the theory, and its predictions and partial explanations (cf. descriptive vs explanatory theories) regarding,

- [[DC Conductivity]]
- [[Heat Capacity]]
- [[Hall Effect]]
- [[Thermal conductivity]]

This theory is notable in that it was created only slightly after the discovery of the electron and *before* the development of the [[Rutherford Model of the Atom]].

## [[Classification of Electrons around a Metallic Atom]]

In the [[Drude Model]] electrons in atoms are split into two classifications,

- [[Core Electrons]], which are bound strongly to the atom's nucleus.
- [[Valence Electrons]] which are bound much weaker.

Mathematically this is framed as the atom having:

- Nuclear charge $eZ_a$.
- $Z$ [[Valence Electrons]]
- $Z_a-Z$ [[Core Electrons]]

Note that $Z_a > Z$.

## [[Conduction Sea]]

When atoms of a metallic element condense to form a metal, the [[Valence Electrons]] detach themselves form the atoms themselves (being bound much weaker) and are able to move throughout the metal, these are known as [[Conduction Electrons]]. Whereas the [[Core Electrons]] remain bound to the nuclei and form a *compensating background of positively charged ions*.

Using the notation discussed in [[Classification of Electrons around a Metallic Atom]], we say that each atom contributes its $Z$ [[Valence Electrons]] to the metal where they become [[Conduction Electrons]].


## [[Conduction Electron Density]]

The [[Conduction Electron Density]] $n$ is the the volumetric density of conduction electrons, given by for a [[Unit Cell]] as,

$$
n = \frac{\sum_\mu Z_\mu}{V}
$$

where $Z_\mu$ is the number of [[Valence Electrons]] contributed for the atom $\mu$ in the cell. For single species cells this simplifies to,

$$
n = \frac{Z \times M}{V}
$$

where $M$ is the number of atoms in the cell.

Note that these are traditionally given in units of $\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.

### Radial Separation

From this [[Conduction Electron Density]] we can compute the typical distance between any two [[Core Electrons]] given by the radius of a Sphere containing 1 electron, ie:

$$
\bigg(\frac 43 \pi r_s^3\bigg) n = 1.
$$

This is normally in the range $1 \to 5 \,\angstrom$.

This allows us to work out properties such as the [[Electrostatic potential]] between two electrons. For a copper atom this has an approximate value of $E = 1.6 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{J} = 10 \,\mathrm{eV}$.

## [[Drude Model]]

### Assumptions

The [[Drude Model]] is based on the following assumptions:

1. Between collisions, electron interactions are negligible.
	- This includes with other electrons and the ions.
		- Omitting the electron–electron interaction is called the *independent electron approximation*, and is surprisingly good.
			- Cf. Fermi Liquid Theory
		- Omitting ion–electron interactions is called the *free-electron approximation* and will be revisited later.
	- Only external fields exert forces on electrons
2. Collisions are are instantaneous.
	- This is inline with the [[Kinetic Theory of Gasses]] approximation.
	- It is a naive approximation but the dependence is not on the mechanism but the result so it functions.
3. Electrons collide with a constant (and thus independent) probability.
	- This approximates the system as a [[Poisson Distribution]] I think? Or possibly a [[Headless Geometric Distribution]] as seen in PropMat.
	- Probability $\frac 1\tau$ per unit time.
	- During interval $\d t$ it is $\frac {\d t}\tau$.
	- $\tau$ is known as the Relaxation Time, Collision Time, Scattering Time or the [[Mean Free Time]].
	- $\tau^{-1}$ is the relaxation rate, collision rate, etc.
4. Electrons are in **thermal equilibrium** with their surroundings.
	- Thus after a collision electrons will move randomly with a kinetic energy given by $\frac 32 k_B T_{\text{local}}$ where $T_{\text{local}}$ is to account for temperature gradients and hence conduction.

### Equation of Motion

In free space we start with the equation,
