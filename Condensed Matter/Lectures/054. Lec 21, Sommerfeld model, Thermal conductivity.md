## [[Sommerfeld Theory]] and [[Thermal Conductivity]]

Recall that [[Fourierâ€™s Law]] gives the heat flow to be proportional to the temperature gradient,

$$
\vq = -\kappa \nab T
$$

and further that by the [[Wiedemann-Franz Law]] the ratio of the [[Thermal Conductivity]] to the [[Electrical Conductivity]] is given by,

$$
\frac\kappa \sigma = \mathcal{L}T.
$$

The [[Drude Model]] examined earlier gives a value of,

![[046. Lec 16, Drude model, Thermal conductivity#^final-heat-flow]]

and a [[Thermal Conductivity]] of,

![[046. Lec 16, Drude model, Thermal conductivity#^final-conductivity]]


> cf. [[046. Lec 16, Drude model, Thermal conductivity]]

In the quantum case still use this expression for $\kappa$ however,

- The volumetric [[Heat Capacity]] $c_V$ is smaller by a factor of about $\approx \frac{T}{T_F} = \frac{k_BT}{T_F} \approx 0.01$ #todo WTF DOES THIS MEAN. ANSWERE: $0.01 v = v'$
- $v^2$ is given by $v^2_F = \frac{2\epsi_F}{m}$ which is larger by a factor of $\frac{\epsi_F}{k_BT} \approx 100$.

Noting that these two corrections roughly cancel out we get a value of $\mathcal{L}$ to be,

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{\pi^2}{3} \(\frac{k_B}{e}\)^2 = 2.4~\mathrm{W.\Omega.K^{-2}}
$$

much more inline with the values seen in [[046. Lec 16, Drude model, Thermal conductivity]].
