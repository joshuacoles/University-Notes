In the [[024. Lec 6, Crystal Structure 3, The basis|previous lecture]] we discussed the amplitudes of the x-rays scattering from the different atoms in the $\ce{CsCl}$ crystal structure. These are called [[Form Factor|Form Factors]]. For x-rays these are due to the electrons in the atom.

## Derivation for [[X-Ray Probes]]

When an [[X-Ray Probes]], represented as an oscillating [[Electric Field]] (see [[Lec 9, Waves in a Vacuum#Wave solutions]] for more),

$$
\E = \E_0 \sin\omega t,
$$

with the force given in the traditional manner (does this have a name #todo). This will cause the charged particle incident by the wave to oscillate around its average position,

$$
\r = \r_0 + \vec{d} \sin\omega t,
$$

where $\vec{d}$ is the amplitude of the oscillation. Taking this we can clearly see,

$$
\begin{align*}
\ddot{\r} = - \omega^2 \vec{d} \sin\omega t &= \frac \F m \\

&= \frac{q\E}m \\
&= \frac{q\E_0\sin\omega t}m,
\end{align*}
$$

which with a little rearrangement gives,

$$
\vec{d} = -\frac{q \E_0}{m \omega^2}.
$$

Thus we have a charge $q$ oscillating with a displacement $\vec{d}$. This will act as a [[Dipole Radiator]], producing an [[Electric Field]] $\E \propto q\vec{d}$. This oscillating electric field is in fact, the scattered [[X-Ray Probes|X-Ray Probe]]. Thus we come to the final relation,

$$
\norm{\vec{d}} \propto \frac{q^2}{m\omega^2}.
$$

> #todo Please check that $q^2$ dependence, should be easy with units I'm just hungry.

This explains why electrons have a much stronger interaction with [[X-Ray Probes]] than protons due to their substantially lower mass.

## Factors Effecting the use of [[X-Ray Probes]] with regards to form factors

- $f \sim Z$, **atomic number**
	- Hard to observe light elements when heavy elements are present.
	- Further it is is hard to distinguish similar elements (eg. $\Delta Z = \pm 1,\pm2$).

For examples $\ce{KCl}$ vs $\ce{KBr}$

These have very different diffraction patterns, but in fact have the same [[Crystal Structure]] $\ce{CsCl}$ and generally very similar. Why is this?

However due to the highly electronegative, ionic bond between the $\ce{K}$ and $\ce{Cl}/\ce{Br}$, the [[X-Ray Probes|X-Rays]] in fact perceive a [[Simple Cubic Crystal Structure]], with half the lattice constant of the respect [[Cesium Chloride Crystal Structure]] (note this would not have a basis in the traditional sense).

## Neutron Form Factor

[[Neutron Probes]] undergoing a very different process to [[X-Ray Probes]], scattering from the nucleus as opposed to the electrons, have a different form factor, as shown below (vs atomic weight $Z$).

The dashed curve showing the ideal curve from the increased cross section due to larger atomic number. The rather more erratic solid curve seen on the graph is caused by momentary binding of the neutron when it is incident on a nucleus, before being ejected again. The precise details of this resonant process are sensitive to the detailed composition of the nucleus.

Overall we can observe the following,

- Is that the neutron form factors vary over a range of $3\to4$ for all the elements (what does this actually mean ??? #todo)
- Heavy elements do not dominate over lighter elements, making [[Neutron Probes]] useful in determining the location of hydrogen atoms in complex solids 
- Neighbouring elements often have different form factors due to size and resonance effects.
- Can also vary across isotopes, useful in structure effects of liquids and amorphous solids.
- The scattering amplitude can actually be complex, giving negative values as shown on the graph (huhhhh??? #todo)
	- This also allows us to get structures with equal positive and negative components as to cancel out on average, thus not diffracting neutrons.
	- These can be useful as containers for structure determination, especially of liquids.
- Finally neutrons have a [[Magntic Moment]] which can interact with unpaired spins and probe the magnetic structure of crystals.
