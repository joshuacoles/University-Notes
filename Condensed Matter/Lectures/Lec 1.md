## [[Crystal Structure]]
A [[Crystal]] is a *"a solid material whose constituents are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure"*.

> Regular, long range order.

Conceptually is it comprised of two components,

- The [[Lattice]]
- And the [[Crystal Basis|Basis]]

The [[Lattice]] is defined by translational symmetries and the crystal structure is identified by the symmetries of the [[Lattice]] and [[Crystal Basis]]. This has a strong effect on the physical properties of the material.

### [[Lattice]]
A lattice is an **infinite array of points in space**, each having **identical surroundings to the others**.

The [[Lattice]] is the span over the **integers** of a set of [[primitive vectors]], for example any combination of $\vec{a}_1$'s and $\vec{a}_2$'s form a set of [[primitive vectors]] for the crystal below.
