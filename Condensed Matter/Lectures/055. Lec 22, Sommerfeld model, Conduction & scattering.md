## [[Sommerfeld Theory]] and [[Electrical Conductivity]]

When subjecting electrons to a constant [[Electric Field]] $\E$ they undergo a the [[Lorentz Force]] given by

$$
\F = -e\E
$$

which applying it to the standard equation of motion (phrase in terms of the [[Wave Vector]] $\vk$),

$$
\begin{align*}
\F   &= m\dot\vp \\
     &= \hbar \dot\vk \\
-e\E &= \hbar \dot\vk \\\\

\dot\vk &= \frac {-e}{\hbar}\E
\end{align*}
$$

leading to the solution,

$$
\vk(t) = \vk_0 + \frac{-e\E}{\hbar}t
$$

which corresponds with a rigid displacement of the occupied sphere of states, initially equal to the [[Fermi Sphere]] when there is no $\E$ applied.

When there is an $\E \ne 0$ however we can say that the $\langle \vk \rangle \ne 0$ and thus [[Current]] flows as there is no longer a balance of charges with [[Wave Vector|Wave Vectors]] moving left and right. Looking at this quantitatively we will see,

$$
\langle \vk \rangle = \frac{-e\E}{\hbar}t
$$

due to the symmetries of the occupied sphere of states. However this implies that $\lim_{t \to \infty} \vk = \infty \implies \lim_{t \to \infty} I = \infty$ which is clearly non-physical as we know the system will re. This implies the existence of some process which works to displace the occupied states back to the origin of the space (as would occur when the current is removed).

(there is a net movement of charge against the $\E$ field, as expected with negative charges).

In the idealised case the net-displacement in $\vk$ space will continue to increase and thus the current with it. However in actuality the system will reach a [[Steady State]] with a constant [[Current]].

This can be intuited by considering what happens when the current is removed, once this has occurred the occupied sphere will move back to the origin, implying the existence of some process within the crystal that move
