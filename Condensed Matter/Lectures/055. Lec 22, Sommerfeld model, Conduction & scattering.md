## [[Sommerfeld Theory]] and [[Electrical Conductivity]]

When subjecting electrons to a constant [[Electric Field]] $\E$ they undergo a the [[Lorentz Force]] given by

$$
\F = -e\E
$$

which applying it to the standard equation of motion (phrase in terms of the [[Wave Vector]] $\vk$),

$$
\begin{align*}
\F   &= m\dot\vp \\
     &= \hbar \dot\vk \\
-e\E &= \hbar \dot\vk \\\\

\dot\vk &= \frac {-e}{\hbar}\E
\end{align*}
$$

leading to the solution,

$$
\vk(t) = \vk_0 + \frac{-e\E}{\hbar}t
$$

which corresponds with a rigid displacement of the [[Fermi Sphere]].

Initially when there is no $\E$ field (ie $\E = 0$) the [[Fermi Sphere]] is centered at the origin, however when $\E \ne 0$,  $\langle \vk \rangle \ne 0$ and current flows (there is a net movement of charge against the $\E$ field, as expected with negative charges).

In the idealised case the net-displacement in $\vk$ space will continue to increase and thus the current with it. However in actuality the system will reach a [[Steady State]] with a constant [[Current]].

This can be intuited by considering what happens when the current is removed, once this has occured
