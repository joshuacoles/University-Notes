## [[Sommerfeld Theory]] and [[Electrical Conductivity]]

When subjecting electrons to a constant [[Electric Field]] $\E$ they undergo a the [[Lorentz Force]] given by

$$
\F = -e\E
$$

which applying it to the standard equation of motion (phrase in terms of the [[Wave Vector]] $\vk$),

$$
\begin{align*}
\F   &= m\dot\vp \\
     &= \hbar \dot\vk \\
-e\E &= \hbar \dot\vk \\\\

\dot\vk &= \frac {-e}{\hbar}\E
\end{align*}
$$

leading to the solution,

$$
\vk(t) = \vk_0 + \frac{-e\E}{\hbar}t
$$

which corresponds with a rigid displacement of the occupied sphere of states, initially equal to the [[Fermi Sphere]] when there is no $\E$ applied.

When there is an $\E \ne 0$ however we can say that the $\langle \vk \rangle \ne 0$ and thus [[Current]] flows as there is no longer a balance of charges with [[Wave Vector|Wave Vectors]] moving left and right. Looking at this quantitatively we will see,

$$
\langle \vk \rangle = \frac{-e\E}{\hbar}t
$$

due to the symmetries of the occupied sphere of states, displayed graphically below.

However this implies that $\lim_{t \to \infty} \vk = \infty \implies \lim_{t \to \infty} I = \infty$ which is clearly non-physical as we know the system will reach a [[Steady State]] of finite constant current given by [[Ohm's Law]]. This implies the existence of some process which works to displace the occupied states back to the origin of the space (as would occur when the current is removed).

This is due to a scattering process corresponding to a change in [[Wave Vector]] of the electrons, the origins of which are impurities/defects in the crystal and also [[Lattice Vibrations]] which on their own would relax the distribution of $\vk$ states.

In the [[Steady State]] of constant [[Current]] above a balance is established between the effects of the constant electric field displacing the $\vk$ vectors, and also the scattering process which push them towards the origin.

### Scattering

There are two kinds of scattering process, *elastic* and *inelastic*.
