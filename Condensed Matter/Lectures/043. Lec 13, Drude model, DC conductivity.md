## [[Resistivity]]

 According to [[Ohm's Law]] the current flowing through a wire it proportional to the potential drop along its length, $V = IR$.
 
The [[Resistance]] however is not a [[Material Property]] but instead dependent on the geometric structure of the object in question. Seeking an intrinsic material property we define the [[Resistivity]] $\rho~\mathrm{\Omega.m}$ and the inverse quantity the [[Conductivity]]  $\sigma$, related to the [[Electric Field]] $\E$ and the [[Charge Dentity]] $\J$ by,

$$
\E = \rho \J \quad \J = \sigma \E
$$

> **Note**: For now we define these as scalar quantities, however this will eventually be extended to Scalar Fields, allowing variation across the material, and further Vectors and Vector Fields allowing for non [[Isotrophic]] behaviour.

### Resistivity of Cuboid Solids

Applying these to the situation given above we know the following,

- $\J = \frac IA$
- $V = \E \dp L$

Hence we have, 

$$
\begin{align*}
V &= \E L \\
V &= \rho \J L \\
V &= \rho \frac{I}{A} L \\
IR &= \rho \frac{I}{A} L \\
R &= \rho \frac{L}{A} \\
\end{align*}
$$

## [[Current Density]] of Drifting Charges

Given a collection of identical charges moving an an average velocity $\vv$, we define the [[Current Density]] as,

$$
\J = - n q \vv
$$

where $n~\mathrm{.m^{-3}}$ is the density of charges and $q~\mathrm{C}$ their strength.

## [[Drude Model]] and [[DC Conductivity]]

Analysing the situation of [[DC Conductivity]] inline with the [[Drude Model]] (cf [[042. Lec 12, Electrons in solids, Drude model#Assumptions]]) we have the following.

Electrons within the conductor experience an external force, namely the [[Lorentz Force]] $\F = e\E$ due the the externally applied [[Electric Field]]. Taking the [[042. Lec 12, Electrons in solids, Drude model#Equation of Motion]]

![[042. Lec 12, Electrons in solids, Drude model#^262e1d]]

We consider the system in a Stead State, ignoring the initial Transient Behaviour. Thus with time derivatives taken to $0$ we have,


$$
\begin{align*}
\F &= \frac{\vp}{\tau} \\
e\E &= \frac{\vp}{\tau} \\
\vp &= -e \tau \E
\end{align*}
$$

This gives us the average velocity of the electrons, and further the *[[Drift Velocity]]* of the electrons, the average speed *with* collisions. By [[#Current Density of Drifting Charges]] this gives us a current density,

$$
\begin{align*}
\J &= - n e \frac{-e \tau \E}{m} \\
\J &= \frac{ne^2 \tau}{m} \E
\end{align*}
$$

which given $\J \propto I \land \E \propto V$ is equivalent to [[Ohm's Law]] as desired. Further it also gives us a value,

$$
\sigma = \frac{ne^2 \tau}{m} \qquad \rho = \frac{m}{ne^2 \tau}
$$

for the [[Conductivity]] and thus trivially the [[Resistivity]].

This when combined with [[#Resistivity of Cuboid Solids]] gives us an experimental means of determining $\tau$ going from $R \to \rho \to \tau$ (see [[042. Lec 12, Electrons in solids, Drude model#Conduction Electron Density]] for $n$).

### [[Mean Free Path]]

From the [[Mean Free Time]] we can determine the [[Mean Free Path]],

$$
l = v \tau
$$


with $v$ [[Drift Velocity]] given from the assumption of [[042. Lec 12, Electrons in solids, Drude model#^d1bdc3|electrons being in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings]]. This leads to values of $v \approx 10^7 \mathrm{cm.s^{-1}}$ & $l \approx 1 \to 10~\angstrom$, values consistent with scattering in ions.

However in the cases of low $T$ or very pure samples $\rho$ is found to be much smaller, and $v$ much greater than otherwise, this means $l$ can reach $\mathrm{cm} = 10^8~\angstrom$ ranges. This is strong evidence against Electronâ€“Ion interactions being the dominant factor as is assumed in the [[Drude Model]].
