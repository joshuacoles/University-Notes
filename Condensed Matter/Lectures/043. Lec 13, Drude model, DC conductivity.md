## [[Drude Model]] and [[DC Conductivity]]

 According to [[Ohm's Law]] the current flowing through a wire it proportional to the potential drop along its length, $V = IR$.
 
 The [[Resistance]] however is not a [[Material Property]] but instead dependent on the geometric structure of the object in question. Seeking an intrinsic material property we define the [[Resistivity]] $\rho~\mathrm{\Omega.m}$ and a related quantity the [[Conductivity]]  $\omega$, related to the electric field $\E$ and the c
