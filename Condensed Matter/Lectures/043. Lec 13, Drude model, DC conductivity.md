## [[Drude Model]] and [[DC Conductivity]]

 According to [[Ohm's Law]] the current flowing through a wire it proportional to the potential drop along its length, $V = IR$.
 
The [[Resistance]] however is not a [[Material Property]] but instead dependent on the geometric structure of the object in question. Seeking an intrinsic material property we define the [[Resistivity]] $\rho~\mathrm{\Omega.m}$ and the inverse quantity the [[Conductivity]]  $\sigma$, related to the [[Electric Field]] $\E$ and the [[Charge Dentity]] $\J$ by,

$$
\E = \rho \J \quad \J = \sigma \E
$$

> **Note**: For now we define these as scalar quantities, however this will eventually be extended to Scalar Fields, allowing variation across the material, and further Vectors and Vector Fields allowing for non [[Isotrophic]] behaviour.

Applying these to the situation given above we know the following,

- $\J = \frac IA$

### [[Current Density]] of Drifting Charges

Given a collection of identical charges moving an an average velocity $\vv$, we define the [[Current Density]] as,

$$
\J = - n q \vv
$$

where $n~\mathrm{.m^{-3}}$ is the density of charges and $q~\mathrm{C}$ their strength.
