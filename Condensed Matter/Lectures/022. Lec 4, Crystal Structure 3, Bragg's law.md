## [[Bragg's Law]]

[[Bragg's Law]] is a mathematical model which can be used to interpret diffraction patterns. It is given as,

$$
n \lambda = 2 d \sin \theta,
$$

where:

- $n \in \Z$, is the diffraction order.
- $\lambda$, is the wavelength of the probe.
- $d$, is the spacing of the lattice planes (lattice parameter ???).
- $\theta$, the Bragg angle of diffraction.
	- Note this is not the **scattering angle** which is the angular deflection, $\Delta\theta = 2\theta$.

It represents a simple version of diffraction theory.

### Derivation

### Adjacent Atoms

![[Clipboard 22 Feb 2021 at 17.07.png]]

Assuming reflection of the parallel rays off adjacent atoms in a plane, as shown above, we can see that due to the symmetry of the system, the additional path length traveled by the two rays is given by,

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta_1 &= d\cos\theta \\
\Delta_2 &= d\cos\theta.
\end{align*}
$$

Showing that rays diffracting off the plane will have a phase difference of $0$ and thus constructively interfere. This argument is clearly extensible to non-adjacent atoms by considering the chain of atoms between.

### Parallel Planes

We can see on the above diagram, the reasoning behind Bragg's Law, with the bottom ray having to travel a total extra distance of $2 \times d \sin \theta$ to reach the detector.

Which for constructive interference must be an integer number of wavelengths, giving us the Bragg Equation as shown above.

## Josh Derivation

Rays reflecting planes with a separation $d$ will have a path difference of,

$$
2d\sin\theta,
$$

as shown visually above. Thus this gives us a phase difference of,

$$
\delta(\theta , \lambda) = \frac{2d\sin\theta}{\lambda}.
$$

As per [[Wave Interference#Intensity of Interfering Waves]], we will then get an overall intensity of,

![[Wave Interference#^f44f0b]]

which simplifies in our case (considering the waves to be identical and the intensity to be constant across the detector) to the relative intensity of,

$$
i_{\text{Total}} = 1 + \cos(\delta(\theta, \lambda)),
$$

remembering $\theta$ is the Bragg angle, aka the angle between the plane and the incident radiation. This is shown visually (albeit messily) below.

</div>

Thus we looks for pairs $(\theta, \lambda)$ where $i_\text{Total}$ is $1$ (or $0$), giving us point with which to compute $d$.

## Use Experimentally
- We will generally experimentally measure the set of Bragg angles $\set{\theta}$.
- From these we can identify $\set{d}$, which are characteristic of the [[Crystal Structure]] and thus allow us to identify the structure.

Satisfying Bragg's Law however requires a chance occurrence with $\lambda$ & $\theta$, to ensure we actually sample this point. To do this we either scan $\theta$ or $\lambda$ ($x$ or $y$ planes in the above diagram). Examples below

We can do this using three methods,

- [[Rotating Crystal Method]]
- [[Debye-Scherrer Method]]
- [[Laue Method]]

## [[Rotating Crystal Method]]

- Fixed $\lambda$,
- Variable $\theta$.

## [[Debye-Scherrer Method]]
`aliases: ["Powder Method"]`

Here we create a large number of crystal bodies such that the target simultaneously presents all orientations of the sample, no rotation needed.

## [[Laue Method]]

Place a single crystal on adjustable mount incident to a ray of continuous spectrum, then adjust the crystal such as to present an axis of symmetry to the ray.

This will not provide $\set{(\lambda, \theta)}$ sets so $d$ cannot be determined, but the observed patterns will assist other methods by revealing symmetries of the targt.
