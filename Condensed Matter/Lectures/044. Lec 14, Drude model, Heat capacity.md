## [[Drude Model]] and [[Heat Capacity]]

The [[Heat Capacity]] is a measure of the amount of [[Heat]] energy needed to raise the temperature of a solid by a given amount, at constant volume it is given by,

$$
C_V = \(\frac{\d Q}{\d T}\)_V
$$

which from thermodynamics we know we can define as,

$$
C_V = \(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\)_V
$$

from the $\d Q = \d U + p\d V$ relation.

> **Aside**: The heat capacity at constant volume $C_V$ is more fundamentally, however it is very difficult to measure experimentally as materials generally expand as they are heated.
> 
> Instead we use the easier to measure heat capacity at constant pressure $C_P$, these quantities are related through material parameters such as the [[Thermal Expansion Coefficent]] and [[Bulk Modulus]].

This tells us that we need to quantify the [[Internal Energy]] of the metal, wrt to Temperature.

## Internal Energy of [[Drude Model]]

In the [[Drude Model]] [[Conduction Electrons]] behave like a classical gas. Thus applying the [[Equiparition Principle]] we have $\frac 12k_BT$ energy per quadratic degree of freedom. This allows us to quantify the molar [[Internal Energy]] of a metal with valence $Z$ as,

$$
u = (3Z + 3) \frac 12 k_B T
$$
