## [[Hall Effect]]

The [[Hall Effect]] is observed when you apply a voltage $V$ across a material driving a current $I$, in the presence of a perpendicular [[Magnetic Field]], displayed for a simple cuboid below.

The electrons in the material experience a [[Lorentz Force]] given by $\F = -e(\E + \vv \cp \B)$. This leads to the following situation (top down view, ie in the $xy$-plane)

1. Initially, before the $\B$ field is turned on, the [[Current]] flows in the $-x$ direction with the imposed [[Electric Field]].
2. When $\B$ is initially turned on we experience a transient behaviour where the electrons are deflected in the $-y$ direction.
3. However as the electrons are bound to the material this leads to a charge imbalance across the material and thus an additional [[Electric Field]] eventually reaching a Steady State where this field cancels out the [[Magnetic Field]]. This is similar to a [[Capacitors|Capacitor]].
