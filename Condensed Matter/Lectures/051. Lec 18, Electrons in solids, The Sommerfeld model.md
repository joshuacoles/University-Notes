## Comparison of [[Drude Model]] to [[Sommerfeld Theory]]

The [[Drude Model]] is based on a classical understanding of electrons as a gas. However as discussed in [[047. Lec 17, Drude model, Assessment#Assessment of the Drude Model]], this has a number of holes where it fails to correctly predict physical behaviour.

Instead in the [[Sommerfeld Theory]] we consider electrons as quantum objects moving freely in the absence of external fields between collisions.

## [[Sommerfeld Theory]]
 
[[Sommerfeld Theory]] combines the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] and a quantum free electron gas. Representing an electron as a wave function $\psi(\r)$ (satisfying the [[Time Independent SchrÃ¶dinger Equation]]) with one of two possible [[Spin]] values, $\uparrow$ or $\downarrow$, confined to a region of length $L$,

> **Note** that here we set $0$ to be the average potential of the lattice of ions.

## Quantum Statistics Revision

The [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] prevents an occupancy of $> 1$ for any given electron state in our system (in our case $(n, \'{spin})$).

At $T = 0~\mathrm{K}$ all states up to the [[Fermi Energy]] are occupied, and all those above are not. When the system is heated to some $T > 0$ some of these electrons become excited, moving from states below the [[Fermi Energy]] energy (and leaving them free), to those previously unoccupied above it. Thermal physics tells us the probability that a level with energy $\epsi$ is occupied, the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]],

$$
f(\epsi) = \frac{1}{\exp\(-\frac{1}{k_bT}(\mu - \epsi)\) + 1}
$$

where $\mu$ is the [[Chemical Potential]] (aka the [[Fermi Level]]).

> **Note** that $f(\mu) = \frac 12 \,\Forall T$.

>  **Note** that if $\epsi - \mu \gg k_BT$ then this simplifies to the [[Boltzmann Distribution]].

## Extending the 1D Model to 3D

Extending this model to 3D we consider instead the electron confined to a $L \times L \times L$ cuboid, giving a solution

$$
\psi_n(\r) = A \sin\(n_x \pi x \frac 1L\) \sin\(n_y \pi y \frac 1L\) \sin\(n_z \pi z \frac 1L\)
$$

where $n_i \in \N$. 

This however is non-ideal when considering crystals as we generally only focus on properties of the bulk of the crystal, not its surfaces which are present in the equation above. Further this also describes a standing wave, a static solution of little use in transport problems ([[Electrical Conductivity]], [[Thermal Conductivity]], etc).

Instead we extend the domain of the problem from $[0, L]$ to $\R$, and  modify the boundary conditions such that $\psi(x) = \psi(x + L)$, ie the function is periodic by $L$ (these are known as [[Periodic Boundary Conditions]]. Applying this condition we obtain,

$$
\begin{align*}
\psi(x) &= \psi(x + L) \\
A\exp({ikx}) &= A\exp({ik(x + L)}) \\
A\exp({ikx}) &= A\exp({ikx})\exp({ikL}) \\
1 &= \exp({ikL})
\end{align*}
$$

which implies $kL = 2\pi n$. This gives us a quantised [[Wave Vector]] $k = \frac{2\pi n}{L}, n \in \Z$ and thus also quantised energies.
