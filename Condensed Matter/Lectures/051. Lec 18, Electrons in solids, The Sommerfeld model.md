## Comparison of [[Drude Model]] to [[Sommerfeld Theory]]

The [[Drude Model]] is based on a classical understanding of electrons as a gas. However as discussed in [[047. Lec 17, Drude model, Assessment#Assessment of the Drude Model]], this has a number of holes where it fails to correctly predict physical behaviour.

Instead in the [[Sommerfeld Theory]] we consider electrons as quantum objects moving freely in the absence of external fields between collisions.

## [[Sommerfeld Theory]]

[[Sommerfeld Theory]] combines the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] and a quantum free electron gas. Representing an electron as a wave function $\psi(\r)$ (satisfying the [[Time Independent SchrÃ¶dinger Equation]]) with one of two possible [[Spin]] values, $\uparrow$ or $\downarrow$, confined to a region of length $L$,

> **Note** that here we set $0$ to be the average potential of the lattice of ions.

## Quantum Statistics Revision

The [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] prevents an occupancy of $> 1$ for any given electron state in our system (in our case $(n, \'{spin})$).

At $T = 0~\mathrm{K}$ all states up to the [[Fermi Energy]] are occupied, and all those above are not. When the system is heated to some $T > 0$ some of these electrons become excited, moving from states below the [[Fermi Energy]] energy (and leaving them free), to those previously unoccupied above it. Thermal physics tells us the probability that a level with energy $\epsi$ is occupied, the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]],

$$
f(\epsi) = \frac{1}{\exp\(-\frac{1}{k_bT}(\mu - \epsi)\) + 1}
$$

where $\mu$ is the [[Chemical Potential]] (aka the [[Fermi Level]]).

> **Note** that $f(\mu) = \frac 12 \,\Forall T$.

> **Note** that if $\epsi - \mu \gg k_BT$ then this simplifies to the [[Boltzmann Distribution]].

## Extending the 1D Model to 3D

Extending this model to 3D we consider instead the electron confined to a $L \times L \times L$ cuboid, giving a solution

$$
\psi_n(\r) = A \sin\(n_x \pi x \frac 1L\) \sin\(n_y \pi y \frac 1L\) \sin\(n_z \pi z \frac 1L\)
$$

where $n_i \in \N$.

This however is non-ideal when considering crystals as we generally only focus on properties of the bulk of the crystal, not its surfaces which are present in the equation above. Further this also describes a standing wave, a static solution of little use in transport problems ([[Electrical Conductivity]], [[Thermal Conductivity]], etc).

Instead we extend the domain of the problem from $[0, L]$ to $\R$, and modify the boundary conditions such that $\psi(x) = \psi(x + L)$, ie the function is periodic by $L$ (these are known as [[Periodic Boundary Conditions]]. Applying this condition we obtain,

$$
\begin{align*}
\psi(x) &= \psi(x + L) \\
A\exp({ikx}) &= A\exp({ik(x + L)}) \\
A\exp({ikx}) &= A\exp({ikx})\exp({ikL}) \\
1 &= \exp({ikL})
\end{align*}
$$

which implies $kL = 2\pi n$. This gives us a quantised [[Wave Vector]] $k = \frac{2\pi n}{L}, n \in \Z$ and thus also quantised energies.

> In 2D this is situation would be described as a Torus shown below
> ![[Torus-40-15 copy.jpg]]
> For 3D this situation has no easily analogue as it would be bending through a 4th dimension, something we cannot comprehend.

Written more concisely solutions to this new system can be given as

$$
\psi_\vk(\r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt V} \exp(i\vk \dp \r)
$$

where $\vec{k} = \frac{2\pi}{L}\vec{n}, n \in \Z^3$ (note that $\vec{k}$ is isomorphic to $\vec{n}$ hence we use $\vec{k}$ as the label). This solution will have the following properties,

- **Momentum**: $\vp = \hbar \vk$
- **Energy**: $\epsi(\vk) = \frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m}$

Where it can be observed that the non-relativistic energy-momentum relation $\epsi^2 = \frac{p^2}{2m}$ holds.

### Lattice of Quantised Wave Vectors, [[Fermi Sphere]]

The allowable values of $\vk$ discussed above form a [[Simple Cubic Crystal Lattice]] in [[Reciprocal Space]], with a separation parameter of $\Delta k = \frac{2\pi}{L}$. This gives a volume per point of $(\Delta k)^3 = \frac{8\pi^3}{L^3}$.

![[Pasted image 20210330153453.png]]

The ground state of the electron gas is constructed by filling the lowest energy states with $N$ electrons. Since $\epsi \propto \|\vk\|^2$, the lowest energy states are those closest the origin, and lie within a sphere, called the [[Fermi Sphere]], the radius of which is called the [[Fermi Wave Vector]] $k_F$.

#### Connection to [[Conduction Electron Density]]

We can establish a relation between the volume of the [[Fermi Sphere]], given as $\Omega = \frac 43 \pi k_F^3$, and the number of [[Lattice Point|Lattice Points]] within the sphere. This is,

$$
N_P = \frac{\Omega}{\frac{8\pi^3}{L^3}} = \frac{k_F^3}{6\pi^2} L^3
$$

where each [[Lattice Point]] is associated with two electron states (spin up and down), hence,

$$
N = 2 N_P \implies n = \frac{N}{V} = \frac{k_F^3}{3\pi^2}.
$$

Recalling that $n \approx 1 \to 20 \cp 10^{22}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ we can determine that the [[Fermi Wave Vector]] is $k_f \approx 1~\angstrom^{-1}$. This gives us a wavelength $\lambda_F \approx 1~\angstrom$, thus showing that electrons at the Fermi energy have wavelengths comparable to the spacing of crystal planes.

> This implies that they will undergo [[Diffraction]] from the ion structure.
