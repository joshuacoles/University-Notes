## Comparison of [[Drude Model]] to [[Sommerfeld Theory]]

The [[Drude Model]] is based on a classical understanding of electrons as a gas. However as discussed in [[047. Lec 17, Drude model, Assessment#Assessment of the Drude Model]], this has a number of holes where it fails to correctly predict physical behaviour.

Instead in the [[Sommerfeld Theory]] we consider electrons as quantum objects moving freely in the absence of external fields between collisions.

## [[Sommerfeld Theory]]
 
[[Sommerfeld Theory]] combines the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] and a quantum free electron gas. Representing an electron as a wave function $\psi(\r)$ (satisfying the [[Time Independent SchrÃ¶dinger Equation]]) with one of two possible [[Spin]] values, $\uparrow$ or $\downarrow$, confined to a region of length $L$,

## Quantum Statistics Revision

The [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] prevents an occupancy of $> 1$ for any given electron state in our system (in our case $(n, \'{spin})$).

At $T = 0~\mathrm{K}$ all states up to the [[Fermi Energy]] are occupied, and all those above are not. When the system is heated to some $T > 0$ some of these electrons become excited, moving from states below the [[Fermi Energy]] energy (and leaving them free), to those previously unoccupied above it. Thermal physics tells us the probability that a level with energy $\epsi$ is occupied, the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]],

$$
f(\epsi) = \frac{1}{\exp\(-\frac{1}{k_bT}(\mu - \epsi)\) + 1}
$$

where $\mu$ is the [[Chemical Potential]] (aka the [[Fermi Level]]).

> **Note** that $f(\mu) = \frac 12 \,\Forall T$.
