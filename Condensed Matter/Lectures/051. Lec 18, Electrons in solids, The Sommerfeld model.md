## Comparison of [[Drude Model]] to [[Sommerfeld Theory]]

The [[Drude Model]] is based on a classical understanding of electrons as a gas. However as discussed in [[047. Lec 17, Drude model, Assessment#Assessment of the Drude Model]], this has a number of holes where it fails to correctly predict physical behaviour.

Instead in the [[Sommerfeld Theory]] we consider electrons as quantum objects moving freely in the absence of external fields between collisions.

## [[Sommerfeld Theory]]
 
[[Sommerfeld Theory]] combines the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] and a quantum free electron gas. Representing an electron as a wave function $\psi(\r)$ (satisfying the [[Time Independent SchrÃ¶dinger Equation]]) with one of two possible [[Spin]] values, $\uparrow$ or $\downarrow$, confined to a region of length $L$,

> **Note** that here we set $0$ to be the average potential of the lattice of ions.

## Quantum Statistics Revision

The [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] prevents an occupancy of $> 1$ for any given electron state in our system (in our case $(n, )$)
