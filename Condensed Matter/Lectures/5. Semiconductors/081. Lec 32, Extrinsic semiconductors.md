## [[Extrinsic Semiconductors]]

Whereas [[Intrinsic Semiconductors]] are pure crystal semiconductors, with a low concentration of [[Electron Holes|Holes]] and [[Conduction Band]] electrons[^1], both of which are equal and vary with temperature; we now consider [[Extrinsic Semiconductors]] which have been modified by [[Doping]] making them impure. This will break the explicit equations we have obtained thus far for the concentrations of [[Electron Holes|Holes]] and Conduction Electrons.

[^1]: For context this is about $1$ in $10^{12}$ electrons.

Firstly, the [[Electrical Conductivity]] of a [[Semiconductors|Semiconductor]] is given by,

$$
\sigma = \frac{n e^2 \tau_e}{m_e^*} + \frac{p e^2 \tau_h}{m_h^*}
$$

At first glance this would imply that the introduction of impurities would decrease the conductivity of the semiconductor. However the introduction of the Dopant increases the concentrations conductors substantially overcoming this effect by far.

This process also gives us a wide range of control over the concentrations at different temperatures.

### [[Doping]]

Dopant atoms substitute for semiconductor atoms taking their place in the [[Crystal Structure]], they are thus impurities. They come in two types,

- Electron Donors leading to [[N-Type Extrinsic Semiconductors]]
- Electron Acceptors leading to [[P-Type Extrinsic Semiconductors]].

### [[P-Type Extrinsic Semiconductors]]

P-type semiconductors are made my doping with atoms with an additional **weakly bound valance electron**, this is normally the replacement of a Group 4 atom (eg. Silicon) with a Group 5 atom (eg. Phosphorus). This weakly bound atom is easily thermally excited into the [[Conduction Band]] leaving behind an **ionised donor atom**.

### Common Doping Elements

Note that the behaviour is dependent on the atom making up the semiconductor.

## [[Hydrogen Model for Donors]]

The addition of the Group 5 atom to the crystal leads to the addition of one extra electron and proton to the otherwise pure periodic crystal. This extra electron will orbit the donor atom in a manner similar to a single electron hydrogen atom, however with some important difference.

### Divergence from Hydrogen

1. Firstly the extra electron is not orbiting a [[Source Free Vacuum]], instead it is experiencing a [[Periodic Potential]] from the lattice.
	- This means we must replace the mass of the electron with an effective mass caused by said lattice.
2. This also screens to the effect of the ionised donor core atom which is represented with the higher [[Permeability]] of the Silicon than free space.
	- $\epsi_0 \to \epsi_0\epsi_r$, with $\epsi_r \approx 10$ in most cases

With these divergences we now use the H-atom as a model of donors.

### Application

In a standard hydrogen atom the electron can occupy energy levels given by,

$$
\epsi_n^H = \frac{me^4}{2(4\pu\epsi_0)^2\hbar^2} \frac1{n^2} = \frac{13.6\unit{eV}}{n^2}
$$

where $13.6\unit{eV}$ is the ionisation energy of the electron. It also gives a [[Bohr Radius]], ie the expectation value of the 1s state,

$$
a_0^H = \frac{(4\pi\epsi_0)\hbar^2}{me^2} = 0.529\unit\angstrom
$$

Computing these quantities in the donor model we get,

$$
\epsi_n^D = \frac{m_e^*e^4}{2(4\pu\epsi_0\epsi_r)^2\hbar^2} \frac1{n^2} = \frac{1}{\epsi_r^2}\(\frac{m_e^*}{m}\) \frac{13.6\unit{eV}}{n^2} 
$$

and

$$
a_0^D = \frac{(4\pi\epsi_0\epsi_r)\hbar^2}{m_e^*e^2} = \epsi_r \frac{m}{m_e^*} 0.529\unit\angstrom
$$

These values normally take values of $m^*_e \approx 0.1m, \epsi_r \approx 10$ we  end up with,

$$
\epsi_n^D \approx \frac{13.6\unit{meV}}{n^2}
\qquad
a_0^D \approx 5\unit{nm}
$$

> Note the milli in $\mathrm{\mathbf{m}eV}$

remembering the [[Lattice Parameter]] of a Silicon crystal is measured in $\angstrom$ and thus the treatment of the electron as existing within the lattice is valid. 

### Effect

When an electron has an energy greater than $13.6\unit{meV}$ it is mobile in the crystal and thus must be in the conduction band of the crystal. This has the effect of moving up the "floor" of the electrons, meaning it is much easier to promote electrons to the [[Conduction Band]]. This is shown schematically below. 

![[Pasted image 20210505212625.png]]

Left behind is a positive ion which can scatter

## [[P-Type Extrinsic Semiconductors]]

In contrast to [[N-Type Extrinsic Semiconductors]], p-type are doped with Electron Acceptors, typically from Group 3 on the Periodic table. Replacing a Silicon atom with an Aluminum atom acts like a positive hole, which orbits a negative "missing electron". These are modeled again with a Hydrogen model but along with opposite charges, the [[Electron Holes|Hole]] has a different effective mass and is positive moving towards the valance band instead.

## [[Hydrogen Model for Acceptors]]

![[Pasted image 20210505214052.png]]

The equations in this case are similar to the [[Hydrogen Model for Donors]],

$$
\epsi_n^A = - \frac{1}{\epsi_r^2}\(\frac{m_h^*}{m}\) \frac{13.6\unit{eV}}{n^2}
$$

and

$$
a_0^D = \epsi_r \frac{m}{m_h^*} a_0
$$

Here the hole escaping into the crystal must be into the valence band, and hence on the schematic the direction of the acceptor bands is reversed.

![[Pasted image 20210505214345.png]]

When a hole leaves the acceptor atom it becomes a negative ion.

## [[Fermi Level]] in Extrinsic Semiconductors & Carrier Concentrations

In an [[Intrinsic Semiconductor]] at $T = 0$ the [[Valence Band]] is filled and inert, whereas the [[Conduction Band]] is empty.

![[Pasted image 20210506093303.png]]

### [[N-Type Extrinsic Semiconductors]]

- The doped energy levels will be a fraction of the [[Band Gap]] below the [[Conduction Band]].
- At $T = 0$ the [[Chemical Potential]] coincides with the dopant $n = 1$ level, containing 1 electron in this orbital of the possible 2 (spin up or spin down).
	- In fact Coulomb Repulsion stops double occupation to
- Here we see doping has substantially moved the Fermi Level of the semiconductor, consequentially the concentrations discussed above for the thermally excited electrons.
- The ionisation energy of the dopant electrons is lower than $k_BT$ in most cases and thus we assume that most of the electrons are free within the [[Conduction Band]], leaving the dopant atoms positively ionised.
	- These however do not correspond with holes in the valence band as they did not originate there, breaking the $n = p$ relation.
	- Thus at room temperature the chemical potential must lie below the donor bands as they are unoccupied, falling as temperature increases.
		- Note from [[073. Lec 31, Intrinsic semiconductors#Fermi level of intrinsic semiconductors]] this temperature dependence is not seen in [[Intrinsic Semiconductors]].
	- As the temperature increases further until thermal excitation starts to occur. This will begin to dominate at higher $T$ values as the number of electrons available in the valence band is much greater than the number in the donor bands.
		- At this point it will have reached $\approx \frac 12 E_G$ value of [[Intrinsic Semiconductor]] and the extrinsic semiconductor will as such, with $n \approx p$ as the extrinsic behaviour is outshone.

### [[P-Type Extrinsic Semiconductors]]

- At $T = 0\unit{K}$ each acceptor level contains one hole and thus is empty with the Fermi Level must be between the valence band and the dopant levels, as the probability of occupation of these states is 1/2 (again spin up / spin down).
- At room temperature electrons can be excited into the empty dopant $n = 1$ state (or equivalently the hole is excited down in energy into the Valence Band).
	- Here the concentration of holes in the valence band is equal to the concentration of dopant in the semi-conductor, again breaking $n = p$.
	- At this point the [[Fermi Level]] lies above the $n = 1$ band.
- From here it continues to rise at higher $T$ values.
	- Again we see Intrinsic behaviour return.

### N Type Again but with graphs

![[Pasted image 20210506094413.png]]

- At low temperatures (high $T^{-1}$) electrons are still bound to the donor atoms and thus not excited into the conduction band. This is known as **Freeze Out**.
- As $T$ increases $\mu$ moves down and electrons start to be excited out of the donor levels.
	- This is still well above $\frac12E_G$ and thus the [[Valence Band]] remains essentially untouched.
- Once we pass this region and most electrons have been ionised out of the donor atoms, but we will still be too high for valance band excitation. Here $n = n_D$.
- As we tend towards $E_i$ on the diagram, ie $\frac12 E_G$, we have intrinsic behaviour take hold and dominate as discussed above.

For comparison, compare the curve above to the equation we obtained before for the Fermi Level at different $T$,

$$
\mu = \frac 12 E_G + \frac 34 k_BT \ln\frac{m_h^*}{m_e^*}
$$

we see a much stronger $T$ (or in this case $T^{-1}$) dependence.

### P Type again but without the graph

This is similar to the case for $n$-type.

- Freeze out of hole at low temp.
- Room temp saturation as all acceptors ionised.
- High temperature intrinsic dominated again.
