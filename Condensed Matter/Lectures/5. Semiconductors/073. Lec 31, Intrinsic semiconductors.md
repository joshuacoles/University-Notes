## [[Intrinsic Semiconductor]]

An [[Intrinsic Semiconductor]] is a **pure** [[Semiconductor]], in thermal equilibrium the electrons in the [[Conduction Band]] are those excited across the energy gap $E_G$ from the [[Valence Band]],

We assume the distribution is governed by the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]]. Each electron excited into the [[Conduction Band]] leaves a [[Hole]] in the [[Valence Band]], and hence the electron concentration in the conduction band $n$ is equal to the concentration of the holes in the [[Valence Band]] $p$, these will be distinguished in the case of [[Intrinsic Semiconductor|Intrinsic Semiconductors]] by the suffix $i$,

$$ n_i = p_i $$

Our aim is to compute these concentrations as a function of $T$. These have [[Density of States]] functions given below, derived from the equations given in [[Sommerfeld Theory]] (cf [[052. Lec 19, Sommerfeld model, Density of states]]).

For [[Conduction Band]] electrons, the relation between energy and wave vector is given by,

$$ \epsi - E_G = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_e^*} $$

with a corresponding density of states function,

$$
g_e(\epsi) =
\frac{V}{2\pi^2}
\(\frac{2m_e^*}{\hbar^2}\)^{\frac32}
\sqrt{\epsi - E_G}.
$$

For the holes the energy-wave vector relation is,

$$
\epsi = -\frac{\hbar^2 k_1^2}{2m_h^*}
$$

having a similar density of states function,

$$
g_h(\epsi) =
\frac{V}{2\pi^2}
\(\frac{2m_h^*}{\hbar^2}\)^{\frac32}
\sqrt{-\epsi}.
$$

> Remember that $m_h^*$ is positive, and their energies negative, henc

> Note that the [[Effective Mass]] of holes is often larger than the [[Effective Mass]] of electrons.

### Density of Occupied States

The density of occupied electron states at a given energy level in the [[Conduction Band]] is

$$ n(\epsi) = g_e(\epsi)f_e(\epsi)$$

where $f_e$ is the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]] occupation function for electrons.


Since we know that the [[Valence Band]] is almost completely full and the [[Conduction Band]] is almost empty, hence $f_e$ goes from $1 \to 0$ across this region and hence we assume $\mu$ the [[Chemical Potential]] (the value at which $f_e(\mu) = \frac 12$) is somewhere between. At relevant $T$, we have $\epsi - \mu \gg k_BT$. ($1eV$ vs $0.026eV$). Therefore for energies in the [[Conduction Band]] we can approximate the occupation function as,

$$
f_e(\epsi) \approx \exp\(\frac{\mu - \epsi}{k_BT}\)
$$

This gives a number of states,

$$
N_e = \int_{E_G}^\infty g_e(\epsi)f_e(\epsi) \d\epsi
$$

and an overall concentration $n = \frac NV$,

$$
n =
\frac 1{2\pi^2}
\(\frac{2m_e^*}{\hbar^2}\)^{\frac 32}
\exp\(-\frac{\mu}{k_BT}\)
\int_{E_G}^\infty
	\sqrt{\epsi - E_G} \exp\(-\frac{\epsi}{k_BT}\)
\d\epsi
$$
