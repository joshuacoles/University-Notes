## [[Intrinsic Semiconductor]]

An [[Intrinsic Semiconductor]] is a **pure** [[Semiconductor]], in thermal equilibrium the electrons in the [[Conduction Band]] are those excited across the energy gap $E_G$ from the [[Valence Band]],

We assume the distribution is governed by the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]]. Each electron excited into the [[Conduction Band]] leaves a [[Hole]] in the [[Valence Band]], and hence the electron concentration in the conduction band $n$ is equal to the concentration of the holes in the [[Valence Band]] $p$, these will be distinguished in the case of [[Intrinsic Semiconductor|Intrinsic Semiconductors]] by the suffix $i$,

$$ n_i = p_i $$

Our aim is to compute these concentrations as a function of $T$. These have [[Density of States]] functions given below (cf [[Sommerfeld Theory]])

> Note that the [[Effective Mass]] of holes is often larger than the [[Effective Mass]] of electrons.

### Density of Occupied States

The density of occupied electron states in the [[Conduction Band]] is $g_e(\epsi)f_e(\epsi)$ where $f_e$ is the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]] occupation function for electrons. Since we know that the [[Valence Band]] is almost completely full
