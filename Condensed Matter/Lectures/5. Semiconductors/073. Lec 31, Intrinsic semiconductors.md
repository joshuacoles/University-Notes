## [[Intrinsic Semiconductor]]

An [[Intrinsic Semiconductor]] is a **pure** [[Semiconductors]], in thermal equilibrium the electrons in the [[Conduction Band]] are those excited across the energy gap $E_G$ from the [[Valence Band]],

![[Pasted image 20210503183800.png]]

We assume the distribution is governed by the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]]. Each electron excited into the [[Conduction Band]] leaves a [[Hole]] in the [[Valence Band]], and hence the electron concentration in the conduction band $n$ is equal to the concentration of the holes in the [[Valence Band]] $p$, these will be distinguished in the case of [[Intrinsic Semiconductor|Intrinsic Semiconductors]] by the suffix $i$,

$$ n_i = p_i $$

Our aim is to compute these concentrations as a function of $T$. These have [[Density of States]] functions given below, derived from the equations given in [[Sommerfeld Theory]] (cf [[052. Lec 19, Sommerfeld model, Density of states]]).

For [[Conduction Band]] electrons, the relation between energy and wave vector is given by,

$$ \epsi - E_G = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_e^*} $$

with a corresponding density of states function,

$$
g_e(\epsi) =
\frac{V}{2\pi^2}
\(\frac{2m_e^*}{\hbar^2}\)^{\frac32}
\sqrt{\epsi - E_G}.
$$

For the holes the energy-wave vector relation is,

$$
\epsi = -\frac{\hbar^2 k_1^2}{2m_h^*}
$$

> **NOTE** I have no fucking clue where that $-$'ve came from, shoot me. Maybe as we are taking relative to the top of the valence band?

having a similar density of states function,

$$
g_h(\epsi) =
\frac{V}{2\pi^2}
\(\frac{2m_h^*}{\hbar^2}\)^{\frac32}
\sqrt{-\epsi}.
$$

> Note that the [[Effective Mass]] of holes is often larger than the [[Effective Mass]] of electrons so it has a greater rate of change.

### Density of Occupied States

#### Conduction Band

The density of occupied electron states at a given energy level in the [[Conduction Band]] is

$$ n(\epsi) = g_e(\epsi)f_e(\epsi) $$

where $f_e$ is the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]] occupation function for electrons. A graph of which is shown below,

![[Pasted image 20210503185242.png]]

Since we know the [[Conduction Band]] is almost empty, and the [[Valence Band]] is effectively full, we know $f_e(\epsi < 0) \approx 1$  and $f_e(\epsi > E_g) \approx 0$ (the $\epsi = 0$ point being the peak of the [[Valence Band]]), and hence we assume that the midpoint of the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]], the chemical potential $\mu$, is at the midpoint of these two boundaries. Further still, 

Since the [[Conduction Band]] is almost empty, we know that the value of $f_e(\epsi)$ must be very close to zero in the region $\epsi > E_G$. Further, since the occupied energies $\epsi > E_G$ and thus $\epsi - \mu$ is so much greater than $k_BT$ in the relevant regions, hence we can approximate the distribution as,

$$
f_e(\epsi) \approx \exp\(\frac{\mu - \epsi}{k_BT}\).
$$

This gives a number of states,

$$
N_e = \int_{E_G}^\infty g_e(\epsi)f_e(\epsi) \d\epsi
$$

and an overall concentration $n = \frac NV$,

$$
n =
\frac 1{2\pi^2}
\(\frac{2m_e^*}{\hbar^2}\)^{\frac 32}
\exp\(\frac{\mu}{k_BT}\)
\int_{E_G}^\infty
	\sqrt{\epsi - E_G} \exp\(-\frac{\epsi}{k_BT}\)
\d\epsi
$$

computed to,

$$
n = 2 \(
	\frac{m_e^* k_BT}{2\pi \hbar^2}
\)^{\frac 32}
\expp{-\frac{(E_g - \mu)}{k_BT}}
$$

where we write the pre-factor as,

$$
\begin{gather}
N_C = 2 \(
	\frac{m_e^* k_BT}{2\pi \hbar^2}
\)^{\frac 32} \\

n = N_C \expp{-\frac{(E_g - \mu)}{k_BT}}
\end{gather}
$$

where $N_C$ is sometimes called the effective density of states for the [[Conduction Band]].

#### Holes

For holes we have a similar product as for electrons,

$$ n_h(\epsi) = g_h(\epsi)f_h(\epsi) $$

where we can relate the distribution of holes in the valance band to that of electrons in the conduction band by noting that holes are created by the movement of an electron from the valance to the conduction, hence

$$ f_h = 1 - f_e$$

which gives us,

![[Screenshot 2021-05-03 at 20.06.24.png]]

Therefore in the [[Valence Band]] the distribution for the holes can be approximated as,

$$
f_e(\epsi) \approx \exp\(\frac{\epsi - \mu}{k_BT}\).
$$

This gives a number equal to,

$$
N_h = \int_{-\infty}^{0} g_h(\epsi) f_h(\epsi) \rd\epsi
$$

and a concentration in the valance band given by $p = \frac{N_h}{V}$,

$$
np =
\frac 1{2\pi^2}
\(\frac{2m_h^*}{\hbar^2}\)^{\frac 32}
\exp\(-\frac{\mu}{k_BT}\)
\int_{E_G}^\infty
	\sqrt{-\epsi} \exp\(\frac{\epsi}{k_BT}\)
\d\epsi
$$

which can be written in terms of an effective density of states for the valence band $N_V$,

$$
\begin{gather}
N_V = 2 \(
	\frac{m_h^* k_BT}{2\pi \hbar^2}
\)^{\frac 32} \\

p = N_V \expp{\frac{- \mu}{k_BT}}
\end{gather}
$$

## Carrier concentrations

With these carrier concentrations in hand we can note that first they are **valid in all semi-conductors**. Further their product,

$$
n \cp p = N_C N_V \expp{-E_G \over k_BT}
$$

which is a) independent of our choice of chemical potential and b) in an [[Intrinsic Semiconductor]] where $n = p$ is equal to $n_i^2$ and hence,

$$
n = p = n_i = \sqrt{N_C N_V} \expp{-E_G \over 2k_BT}
$$

which if $E_G \approx 1 ~\mathrm{eV}$, $T = 300~\mathrm{K}$ then the exponential is $\approx 10^{-9}$, ie very small. This can be increased through [[Doping]].

## Determining gaps

Using the values determined above for the **effective density of states** for the conduction and valance bands, we can do the following

## Fermi level of intrinsic semiconductors

To determine the [[Fermi Level]] of [[Intrinsic Semiconductor|Intrinsic Semiconductors]] we can use the fact that we know $n = p$ and hence,

![[Pasted image 20210505114040.png]]
 

If $m_e^* = m_h^*$ then the effective densities of states $N_C$, $N_V$ are equal and hence $\mu = \frac {E_G}2$. If not
