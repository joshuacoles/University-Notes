## [[Energy Bands]] in [[Semiconductor|Semiconductors]]

A [[Semiconductor]] is a material with the [[Band Gap]] between the highest occupied band, known as the [[Valence Band]], and the lowest unoccupied band, known as the [[Conduction Band]], is $\approx 1 \mathrm{~eV}$.

> We can approximate them as parabolic as we are close to the max / min of a given band. Why are they not to begin with?

## Direct and Indirect Semiconductors

In a [[Direct Band Gap Semiconductor]] the [[Conduction Band]] minimum and the [[Valence Band]] maximum occur at the same [[Wave Vector]], otherwise it is known as a [[Indirect Band Gap Semiconductor]] (left vs right).

These two classifications are relevant when considering the excitation of an electron from the [[Valence Band]] to the [[Conduction Band]] by a photon as shown below.

For a photon with the correct amount of energy, $E \approx 1\mathrm{~eV}$, the corresponding momentum it can impart is about $p = 10^{-3} \angstrom^{-1}$, this is a small fraction of the [[Brillouin Zone]] and thus transitions are approximately vertical lines on the diagrams above.

Instead these excitations also require the involvement of a [[Phonon]] within the crystal structure, with large momentum, but low energy in addition to the photon. This decreases the probability of an excitation dramatically.

## Working Assumptions

- We assume we are dealing with [[Direct Band Gap Semiconductor]] with a maximum / minimum at $\vk = 0$. 
- We will measure energies from the top of the [[Valence Band]] (thus saying $\epsi = 0$ at this point).
- This means that the minimum of the [[Conduction Band]] is $E_G$, the width of the [[Band Gap]] itself.


We approximate the shape of the [[Conduction Band]] as,
$$
\epsi(\vk) = E_G + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^*_C}
$$

where $m^*_C$ is the [[Effective Mass]] is related the to second derivative and is thus positive at the minimum.

Likewise for the [[Valence Band]] we approximate the energy as,

$$
\epsi(\vk) = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^*_V}
$$

where $m^*_C$ is negative as it is at a maximum (see 2nd derivative test).

The number of electrons excited into the [[Conduction Band]] is very dependent on the [[Band Gap]] and the Temperature for [[Intrinsic Semiconductor|Intrinsic Semiconductors]]. For $\ce{Si}$ this is about $10^3 / cm$ much lower than the occupation of lower bands.

> Diamond is an insulator, i and d are [[Indirect Band Gap Semiconductor]] and [[Direct Band Gap Semiconductor]] respectively.

## Holes

In thermally excited [[Semiconductor|Semiconductors]] the number of electrons in the [[Conduction Band]], and thus the number of states in the previously filled and inert [[Conduction Band]], is substantially smaller than the number remaining in the [[Conduction Band]].

This is is more efficient talk about and model [[Holes]] in the [[Conduction Band]] than it is the large number electrons which remain within it. This is done by replacing:

- A band of $N$ electrons which
