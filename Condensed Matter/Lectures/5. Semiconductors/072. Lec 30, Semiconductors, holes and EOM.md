## [[Energy Bands]] in [[Semiconductor|Semiconductors]]

A [[Semiconductor]] is a material with the [[Band Gap]] between the highest occupied band, known as the [[Valence Band]], and the lowest unoccupied band, known as the [[Conduction Band]], is $\approx 1 \mathrm{~eV}$.

> We can approximate them as parabolic as we are close to the max / min of a given band. Why are they not to begin with?

In a [[Direct Band Gap Semiconductor]] the [[Conduction Band]] minimum and the [[Valence Band]] maximum occur at the same [[Wave Vector]], otherwise it is known as a [[Indirect Band Gap Semiconductor]] (left vs right).

These two classifications are relevant when considering the excitation of an electron from the [[Valence Band]] to the [[Conduction Band]] by a photon as shown below.
