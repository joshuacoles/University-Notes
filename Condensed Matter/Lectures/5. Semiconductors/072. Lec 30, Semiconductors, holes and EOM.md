## [[Energy Bands]] in [[Semiconductors|Semiconductors]]

A [[Semiconductors]] is a material with the [[Band Gap]] between the highest occupied band, known as the [[Valence Band]], and the lowest unoccupied band, known as the [[Conduction Band]], is $\approx 1 \mathrm{~eV}$.

> We can approximate them as parabolic as we are close to the max / min of a given band. Why are they not to begin with?

## Direct and Indirect Semiconductors

In a [[Direct Band Gap Semiconductor]] the [[Conduction Band]] minimum and the [[Valence Band]] maximum occur at the same [[Wave Vector]], otherwise it is known as a [[Indirect Band Gap Semiconductor]] (left vs right).

These two classifications are relevant when considering the excitation of an electron from the [[Valence Band]] to the [[Conduction Band]] by a photon as shown below.

![[Direct vs Indirect Band Gap Semiconductor Comparison.png]]

For a photon with the correct amount of energy, $E \approx 1\mathrm{~eV}$, the corresponding momentum it can impart is about $p = 10^{-3} \angstrom^{-1}$, this is a small fraction of the [[Brillouin Zone]] and thus transitions are approximately vertical lines on the diagrams above.

Instead these excitations also require the involvement of a [[Phonon]] within the crystal structure, with large momentum, but low energy in addition to the photon. This decreases the probability of an excitation dramatically.

## Working Assumptions

- We assume we are dealing with [[Direct Band Gap Semiconductor]] with a maximum / minimum at $\vk = 0$. 
- We will measure energies from the top of the [[Valence Band]] (thus saying $\epsi = 0$ at this point).
- This means that the minimum of the [[Conduction Band]] is $E_G$, the width of the [[Band Gap]] itself.


We approximate the shape of the [[Conduction Band]] as,

$$
\epsi(\vk) = E_G + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^*_C}
$$

where $m^*_C$ is the [[Effective Mass]] is related the to second derivative and is thus positive at the minimum.

Likewise for the [[Valence Band]] we approximate the energy as,

$$
\epsi(\vk) = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^*_V}
$$

where $m^*_C$ is negative as it is at a maximum (see 2nd derivative test).

The number of electrons excited into the [[Conduction Band]] is very dependent on the [[Band Gap]] and the Temperature for [[Intrinsic Semiconductor|Intrinsic Semiconductors]]. For $\ce{Si}$ this is about $10^3 / cm$ much lower than the occupation of lower bands.

> Diamond is an insulator, i and d are [[Indirect Band Gap Semiconductor]] and [[Direct Band Gap Semiconductor]] respectively.

## Holes

In thermally excited [[Semiconductors|Semiconductors]] the number of electrons in the [[Conduction Band]], and thus the number of states in the previously filled and inert [[Conduction Band]], is substantially smaller than the number remaining in the [[Conduction Band]].

This is is more efficient talk about and model [[Hole|Holes]] in the [[Conduction Band]] than it is the large number electrons which remain within it. This is done by replacing:

- A band of electron capacity $N$  which has lost $n$ to a higher band.

with

- A full band containing $N$ electrons, in addition to $n$ [[Hole]] particles.

Developing this idea we can see they have properties such as,

- Charge
- Wave vector
- Effective mass
- Velocity
- Energy

### Charge

Since we are using the addition of a [[Hole]] to model the removal of an electron, each process should have the same effect on the charge of a band, thus we can assume the charge a hole is $q_H = +e$.

### [[Wave Vector]]

Again by the same logic removing an electron at [[Wave Vector]] $\vk$ will lead to a change the sum momentum by $-\hbar\vk$, thus the addition of the Hole having the same effect, they must have a wave vector of $\vk_H = -\hbar \vk$.

### Hole energy and [[Effective Mass]]

The energy change of an electron undergoing the excitation from the [[Valence Band]] ($\vk_1, \epsi_1$) to the [[Conduction Band]] ($\vk_2, \epsi_2$) is given by,

$$
\Delta \epsi =
\Bigg[E_G + \frac{\hbar^2 k_2^2}{2m_C^*}\Bigg]
- \Bigg[\frac{\hbar^2 k_1^2}{2m_V^*}\Bigg]
$$

![[Screenshot 2021-05-03 at 18.02.02.png]]

When this is instead replaced by the addition of an electron in the [[Conduction Band]] and the addition of a hole in the [[Valence Band]] (as shown above) to get the same energy change we need,

$$
\begin{align}
\Delta \epsi_C + \Delta \epsi_H 
&= \Bigg[E_G + \frac{\hbar^2 k_2^2}{2m_C^*}\Bigg]
- \Bigg[\frac{\hbar^2 k_1^2}{2m_V^*}\Bigg]

\\

\Delta \epsi_H &= -\frac{\hbar^2 k_1^2}{2m_V^*}
\end{align}
$$

and hence, $m_h^* = - m_V^*$. Note this means it is a positive quantity as $m_V^*$ is negative. Further the hole energy is,

$$
\epsi_h = +\frac{\hbar^2 k_1^2}{2m_h^*}
$$

### Hole Velocity

Considering the [[Current]] in he band, the effect of removing one electron, must be equal to that of adding a hole,

$$
\begin{align}
-e \sum^{N - 1}_{i = 0} \vv_i
= -e \sum^{N}_{i = 0} \vv_i - (-e \vv_e)
&= -e \sum^{N}_{i = 0} \vv_i + (q_h \vv_h) \\

-(-e \vv_e) &= +e \vv_h \\
\vv_e = \vv_h
\end{align}
$$

and thus they have the same velocity.

## Equations of Motion

We previously saw that Equation of Motion for a Quantum Electron is,

$$
\hbar \frac{\d \vk}{\d t} = -e(\E + \vv(\vk) \cp \B)
$$

where $\vv(\vk) = \frac 1\hbar \frac{\d \epsi}{\d\vk}$ is the group velocity based on the [[Dispersion]] of the band at $\vk$. For parabolic bands as per the assumption, 

$$
\epsi(\vk) = \epsi(0) + \frac{\hbar^2\vk^2}{2m^*}
$$

giving a [[Group Wave Velocity]] of,

$$
\vv(\vk) = \frac{\hbar \vk}{m^*}
$$

and hence the standard momentum relation of $\hbar \vk = m^* \vv$.

Further, for electrons the [[Conduction Band]], including the effects of impurities, defects and lattice vibrations, we obtain,

$$
m_e^* \frac{\d \vv_e}{\d t} = -e(\E + \vv_e \cp \B) - m_e^* \frac{\vv_e}{\tau_e}
$$

where $m_e^* = m_C^*$.Â Remarkably this is is the exact same equation as seen in the [[Drude Model]] (cf. [[042. Lec 12, Electrons in solids, Drude model]]). But with different values for the coefficients, specifically the effective mass and the change in the scattering coefficient to reflect that scattering occurs off impurities and other such listed above, not the lattice itself.

For holes in the [[Valence Band]],

$$
m_h^* \frac{\d \vv_e}{\d t} = +e(\E + \vv_h \cp \B) - m_h^* \frac{\vv_h}{\tau_h}
$$

where $m_h^* = -m_V^*$. This is the source of the [[Hall Coefficent]]'s anomalous sign in some materials.

## Current Density

In a semiconductor if there are $n$ electrons per unit volume, and $p$ holes, we will have a [[Charge Dentity]] of, 

$$
\vj_e = n(-e)\vv_e \qquad \vj_h = p(+e)\vv_h
$$

leading to a combined current density if both carriers are present of,

$$
\vj_{total} = \vj_e + \vj_h.
$$
