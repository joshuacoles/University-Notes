Considering a 1D crystal of [[Valence]] 4, at $T \approx 300 K$, some electrons will be thermally excited across the [[Band Gap]], from what would otherwise be a filled and thus inert band, into an empty band above, this causes conduction in both.

The probability of electrons being excited is given by the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]].

A material with this property is known as a [[Semiconductor]], where it conducts at room temperature, but not $T = 0$. 

If the gap is $\gg 1eV$ then the chance of excitation is substantially lower and thus the material is an insulator.
