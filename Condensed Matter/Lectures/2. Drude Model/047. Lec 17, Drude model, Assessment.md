## Assessment of the [[Drude Model]]

The [[Drude Model]] successfully accounts for [[Ohm's Law]] and the [[Wiedemann-Franz Law]] among others however it possesses serious short comings:

- The predicted [[Mean Free Path]] is at low $T$ is incorrect (see [[043. Lec 13, Drude model, DC conductivity#Mean Free Path]])
- The [[Heat Capacity]] is independent of the electrons against the predictions of the [[Drude Model]].
- The sign and magnitude of the [[Hall Coefficent]] cannot be explained in all cases.
- The incorrect [[Lorenz Number]]
- Effect of sample preparation and orientation of crystal has no backing in this theory.
- Properties of alloys are unexplained (cf)
- Optical properties, eg difference between gold and silver
- Magnetism
	- This is less surprising as Magnetism is a quantum pho
