## [[Reciprocal Lattice]]

Crystals can be said possess another lattice which exists in "momentum space", which the diffraction experiments measure. Later we will see this [[Reciprocal Lattice]] is key to describing the electronic and vibrational properties of a [[Crystal Structure]].

Consider the experiment below.

![[Pasted image 20210225150044.png]]

- [[Plane Waves]] with [[Wave Vector]] $\vec{k}$ are incident at an atom located at $\r_j$.
- These are reflected, now having [[Wave Vector]] $\vec{k'}$ towards a detector at $\vec{R}$.
	- Scattering is *coherent*, conserving energy and thus $\norm{\vec{k}} = \norm{\vec{k'}}$.
	- $\norm{\vec{R}} \gg \text{dimensions of the crystal}$.

Leading to the final amplitude form for the radiation from atom $j$, 

$$
A_j = A 
\expi{\vec{k} \dp \vec{r}_j - \omega t}
\cdot f_j
\cdot \frac{\exp\(ik'\|\vec{R} - \vec{r_j}\|\)}{\|\vec{R} - \r_j\|}
$$

where the three terms are,

1. The amplitude of the radiation incident at site $j$.
2. The atomic scattering amplitude of the atom at site $j$.
3. The amplitude at the detector of the spherical wave emitted by the atom.

If the detector is sufficiently far away from the crystal, this can be approximated as,

$$
A_j = A 
\frac{\expi{R - \omega t}}{R}
\cdot f_j
\cdot \exp{\(-i
	(\vec{k'} - \vec{k}) \dp \r_j
\)}
$$

where the three terms are respectively,

1. Constant for the entire crystal (dependent only on the detector).
2. Dependent on the atom species at $j$.
3. Dependent of the location of $j$.

we label the term $\vec{k'} - \vec{k} = \vec{Q}$. This is called the scattering vector, it is displayed schematically below.

#todo prove that.

The two [[Wave Vector|Wave Vectors]] appear on the same unit sphere as this is an elastic collision and $\|\vec{k}\| = \|\vec{k'}\|$. $\theta$ being the [[Bragg Angle]], and $2\theta$ the scattering angle.

### From all atoms

When considering the radiation from all atoms, together we use the form,

$$
A_{TOT} = C \sum_j f_j \exp{\(-i\vec{Q} \dp \r_j\)},
$$

where $C$ is the factor constant for the entire crystal. 

Applying this to a monotonic [[Unitary Crystal Basis]], we can simplify this equation with $f = f_j \,\Forall j$, and the [[Lattice Vector]] $r_j = n\vec{a} + m\vec{b} + l\vec{c}$,

$$
A_{TOT}
= Cf \sum_j  \exp{\(-i\(\vec{Q} \dp (n\vec{a} + m\vec{b} + l\vec{c})\)\)}.
$$

Extending this, since the lattice extends to infinity, $j \sim \Z^3$ and thus,

$$
A_{TOT}
= Cf
\(
\sum_n\exp{\(-in \vec{Q} \dp \vec{a}\)}
\)
\(
\sum_m\exp{\(-im \vec{Q} \dp \vec{b}\)}
\)
\(
\sum_l\exp{\(-il \vec{Q} \dp \vec{c}\)}
\)
$$

which can be re-phrased as,

$$
A_{TOT} = Cf
\cdot S(\vec{Q} \dp \vec{a})
\cdot S(\vec{Q} \dp \vec{b})
\cdot S(\vec{Q} \dp \vec{c}),
$$

where $S(c) = \sum_{n \in \Z} \exp(-inc)$

![[Pasted image 20210310183446.png]]

which as per the slide above is given as,

$$
A_{TOT}(\vec{Q}) = Cf N_a N_bN_c = N_{cells} ~\text{if}~ \vec{Q} \dp \vec{a} = 2\pi h, etc
$$

otherwise,

$$A_{TOT}(\vec{Q}) = 0$$

These give the [[Laue Conditions]] which must be satisfied for diffraction to occur, namely, all of,

- $\vec{Q} \dp \vec{a} = 2\pi x$
- $\vec{Q} \dp \vec{b} = 2\pi y$
- $\vec{Q} \dp \vec{c} = 2\pi z$
- $x,y,z \in \Z$
