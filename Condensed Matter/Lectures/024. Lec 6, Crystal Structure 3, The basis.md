The [[Bragg's Law]] derivation [[022. Lec 4, Crystal Structure 3, Bragg's law#Derivation]] assume all planes in a [[Crystal Structure]] are identically spaced by $d$, and thus all interfere constructively, giving a bright diffraction spot.

This occurs when the planes are lattice planes due to the translational symmetry / periodicity of the [[Crystal Lattice]]. However the introduction of a [[Crystal Basis]] can introduce new planes of atoms, and heterogeneous bases can introduce new atom types which may interact differently, which different amplitudes, affecting the interference pattern.

This leads to the [[Crystal Basis]] being reflected in the **relative intensity** of the diffraction lines. 

## Example, [[Cesium Chloride Crystal Structure]]
Consider $\ce{CsCl}$ shown below, a [[Simple Cubic Crystal Lattice]] and a 2 atom basis of $\ce{Cs}: \mlri000, \ce{Cl}: \mlri{\frac 12}{\frac 12}{\frac 12}$.

For computation we assume that $\ce{Cs}$ atoms scatter with strength $A$, and $\ce{Cl}$ with strength $B$. Due to the weak interaction of [[X-Ray Probes]] with atoms (see [[021. Lec 3, Crystal Structure 3, Probes]]), we can assume any ray detected has only scattered once within the crystal structure, ie. only $\ce{Cs}$ or $\ce{Cl}$, simplifying the maths greatly.

If we consider only the $\ce{Cs}$ atoms in the plane, we will obtain an intensity graph similar to,

> **Programming Note**: Cleanup graph to show intensity $A$.

However when we diffract from an actual sample of $\ce{CsCl}$, both species are present, so the intensity pattern will be a combination of the two, shown below.

Here we see the distance between adjacent parallel planes is now no longer $a$ but instead $\frac a2$.

> **Programming Note**: 5:18, wtf is he talking about why is there the half on the $\lambda$. #todo 

This results in the relative intensity of the different order peaks being proportional to either $(A\pm B)^2$ depending on if $n$ is odd of even.

From this we can clearly see the $\ce{CsCl}$ two atom basis is visible in the **relative intensities** of the peaks.

If this was instead a [[Body Centered Cubic Crystal Structure]] (ie the center atom was of the same species (so is BCC homogeneous basis version of CsCl on a SCL? #todo)) (really need to clean up the structure v lattice distinction #todo), these would be proportional to $(A\pm A)^2$ and thus $\sqrt2A$ & $0$. This would lead to the odd planes "vanishing" in the intensity graphs, inline with what was seen in [[023. Lec 5, Crystal Structure 3, Worked example]].
