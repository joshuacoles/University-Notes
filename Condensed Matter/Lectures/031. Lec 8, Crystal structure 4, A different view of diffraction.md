## [[Reciprocal Lattice]]

Consider the experiment below.

![[Pasted image 20210225150044.png]]

- [[Plane Waves]] with [[Wave Vector]] $\vec{k}$ are incident at an atom located at $\r_j$.
- These are reflected, now having [[Wave Vector]] $\vec{k'}$ towards a detector at $\vec{R}$.
	- Scattering is *coherent*, conserving energy and thus $\norm{\vec{k}} = \norm{\vec{k'}}$.
	- $\norm{\vec{R}} \gg \text{dimensions of the crystal}$.
