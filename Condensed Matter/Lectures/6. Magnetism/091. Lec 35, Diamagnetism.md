## [[Diamagnetism]]

Diamagnetism is a weaker effect visible in materials such as Graphite and frogs with a [[Magnetic Susceptability]] $\chi < 1$. It is also responsible for the [[091. Lec 35, Diamagnetism#Levitation]] of these materials.

### Model

![[Pasted image 20210506215208.png]]

We model [[Diamagnetism]] by considering an electron orbiting a central atom with atomic number $Z$. Initially, when there is no external [[Magnetic Field]] the [[Electrostatic Force]] and the [[Centrepetal Force]] cancel each other out, ie,

$$
\frac{Ze^2}{(4\pi\epsi_0)r^2} = m \omega_0^2 r
$$

this gives an initial orbital frequency of,

$$
\omega_0^2 = \frac{Ze^2}{(4\pi\epsi_0)mr^3}.
$$

Now introducing an external [[Magnetic Field]] $\B = B\uvec{e}_z$, this will leads to the [[Lorentz Force]], $\F_L = q(\vv \cp \B) = -e\vv \cp \B = e\omega r B$.  This adds an additional term to this balance becoming,

$$
\frac{Ze^2}{(4\pi\epsi_0)r^2} + e\omega r B = m \omega^2 r,
$$

> Note that the [[Lorentz Force]] will always act towards the central point, even on swapping thingies. Prove it #todo.

this leads to a quadratic,

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{Ze^2}{(4\pi\epsi_0)mr^3} + \frac{eB}{m}\omega &= \omega^2 \\
\omega^2 - \frac{eB}{m}\omega - \omega_0^2 &= 0
\end{align}
$$

with solutions,

$$
\omega = \frac{-\frac{eB}{m} \pm \sqrt{\(\frac{eB}{m}\)^2 - 4\omega_0^2}}{2}
$$

which we can take as,

$$
\omega = \frac{eB}{m} + \omega_0
$$

by considering the relative sizes of the two squares, and the physics of the problem to deduce we desire the $+$ term.

From this result we can see that the addition of the external [[Magnetic Field]] leads to an increase in $\omega$, and thus an increase in the [[Magnetic Moment]] of the orbital component, given by,

$$
i_{ind} = -\frac{e^2B}{4\pi m} \qquad\implies\qquad |\mu_{ind}| = i_{ind} A = -\frac{e^2B}{4 m} r^2
$$

For an atom with $Z$ electrons, this generalises to,

$$
\mu = Z \frac{e^2B}{4 m} \langle \rho^2 \rangle
$$

where $\langle \rho^2 \rangle = \frac32 \langle r^2 \rangle$ is the expectation value of the distance of the electron within the $xy$-plane for a spherically symmetrical charge distribution. With $N$ atoms per unit volume this gives,

$$
\vM = N \vec\mu \implies \chi = \frac{\mu_0 N \mu}{B} = \frac{-\mu_0 Z N e^2}{6 m} \langle r^2 \rangle
$$

This opposes the direction of the induced field and is the [[Langevin Diamagnetic Susceptability]].

### [[Magnetic Susceptability]]

All materials undergo the process described above however it has a magnitude **substantially less** than that of [[Paramagnetism]] and thus is obscured for any material with Permanent Magnetic Moments, which is instead on the order of about $10^{-3}$.

Also note that this ignores the effects of the [[Conduction Electrons]] but this is similar in magnitude. Further [[Super Conductors]] have $\chi_{dia} = -1$, ie they are perfect [[Diamagnetism|Diamagnets]].

### Levitation

Diamagnetic materials can be Levitated, considering the potential,

$$
U = \vM \dp \B
$$

of a material with [[Magnetisation]] $\vM$, in [[Magnetic Field]] $\B$ which induces it. This gives a force,

$$
\F = \nab(\vM \dp \B) = \frac{\chi}{\mu_0}\nab(\|\B\|^2)
$$

and hence when $\chi < 0$, in the case of [[Diamagnetism|Diamagnets]], the material is attracted to field minima (which exists in free space as opposed to field maxima which cannot, meaning [[Paramagnetism]] cannot lead to levitation in static fields).
