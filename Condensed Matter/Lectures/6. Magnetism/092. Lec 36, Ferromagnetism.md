## [[Antisymmetric Behaviour of Fermion Wavefunctions]]

Given a wave function describing two [[Fermion|Fermions]] identified by $(\r_i, \vs_i)$,

$$
\psi(\r_1, \vs_1, \r_2, \vs_2)
$$

we know that it must be [[Antisymmetric]] under particle exchange $1 \leftrightarrow 2$, ie,

$$
\psi(\r_1, \vs_1, \r_2, \vs_2) = -\psi(\r_2, \vs_2, \r_1, \vs_1)
$$

this leads to the conclusion that states with $(\r_1, \vs_1) = (\r_2, \vs_2)$ have a wave function $\psi \equiv 0$, and hence do not exist. For particles to have the same position, or in fact any other set of quantum variables, they must have differing spins.

I expect this is a Corollary of the more general [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]].

## [[Ferromagnetism]]

Whereas [[Paramagnetism]] occurs when normally randomly orientated [[Magnetic Dipole|Magnetic Dipoles]] become ordered in the presence in an external [[Magnetic Field]], some materials can posses a [[Magnetisation]] $\vM$ even in the absence of a [[Magnetic Field]] $\B_0$. This is known as [[Spontaneous Magnetisation]] (spontaneous as in, without cause). This is a kind of Magnetic Order

### Sources of Magnetic Order

The obvious source of this [[Magnetic Order]] would be dipole-dipole interactions however considering two dipoles of magnitude $\mu_B$ separated by $r\approx 2\unit{\angstrom}$, we see that they have an interaction energy of,

$$
E = \mu_B\mu_0\frac{\mu_B}{4\pi r^2} \approx 10^{-24}\unit{J}
$$

which has a characteristic temperature of $0.1\unit{K}$, implying that any order generated through this interaction will not survive temperature above that. This is in conflict with observed [[Curie Temperature|Curie Temperatures]] shown below

![[Pasted image 20210507151837.png]]

This affect does however come into play when talking about [[092. Lec 36, Ferromagnetism#Magnetic Domains]].

#### The Exchange Interaction

Here we present another source for this [[Magnetic Order]], what we label the Exchange Interaction. This is brought about by the [[Antisymmetric Behaviour of Fermion Wavefunctions]] leading to different [[Electrostatic potential|Electrostatic Potentials]] for states involving electrons with equal or differing spin, even though the Potential itself is **independent of spin**. This is because this antisymmetry, leading to $\psi(r_1 = r_2) = 0$, coupled with the requirements for continuity in the wave function, place restrictions on the overall integral of the wave function, for example in the [[Electrostatic potential]],

$$
U = \left\langle \psi \left|
	\frac{e^2}{4pi\|\r_1 - \r_2\|}
\right| \psi \right\rangle
$$

This is the Exchange Interaction and can be written as,

$$
-2 \mathcal{J}\, \vs_1 \dp \vs_2
$$

where $\mathcal{J}$ is the energy difference between the parallel and anti-parallel states.

### Application of the Exchange Interaction

More generally this energy can be approximated in the [[Heisenberg Hamiltonian]],

$$
\mathcal{H} = \sum_{i, j, i \ne j} \mathcal{J}_{ij}\, \vS_i \dp \vs_j
$$

where $i,j$ are the index of atoms and $\vS_i$ is the total effective spin of atom $i$ (or more precisely the total angular momentum (then why didn't you write that?!!? #todo)).

Applying the *mean field approximation* to this, replacing each $\vS_j$ with its average,

$$
\langle \vS \rangle = \frac1N \sum_j\vS_j
$$

giving us a moment $\vec\mu_j = -g\mu_B \vS_j$ the [[Magnetisation]] $\vM = \frac 1V \sum_j\vec\mu_j$ becomes proportional to $\langle \vS \rangle$ and hence,

$$
\mathcal{H} = \sum_i \vec\mu_i \dp (\lambda \mu_0 \vM) \qquad \lambda = \frac{\sum_{i \ne j} \mathcal{J}_{ij}}{\mu_0 g^2 \mu_B^2 \frac{N}{V}}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the exchange constant. This Exchange Interaction acts similarly to (but apparently is not a) [[Magnetic Field]],

$$
\B_E = \lambda \mu_0 \vM
$$

### [[Curie-Weiss Law]]

Applying this to the equations found in [[083. Lec 34, Paramagnetism#Quantum Theory of Paramagnetism]] we have (considering $L = 0, J = S = \frac12, g = 2$ in an external [[Magnetic Field]] $\B_0$)

$$
M = N \mu_B \tanh\(
	\frac{\mu_B (B_0 + \lambda \mu_0 M)}{k_BT}
\)
$$

Note that this is an [[Implicit Equation]] in $M$, hence we aim for some approximations. 

At high $T$ we can apply $\tanh x \approx x$  and thus,

$$
M = \frac{N\mu_B^2}{k_BT}(B_0 + \lambda \mu_0 M)
$$

which we can now solve for $M$ giving us a modified [[Magnetic Susceptability]] of,

$$
\chi = \mu_0 \frac MB = \frac{C}{T - T_C}
$$

where $C = \frac{N\mu_B^2\mu_0}{k_B}$ is [[Curie's Constant]] as before and $T_C = \lambda C$, where $\lambda$ is a material property. When $T \to T_C$ we can see that $\chi \to \infty$ and hence even in a $\B_0 = \vec0$ case we may have a finite $\vM = \chi{\B_0\over\mu_0}$. This is the [[Spontaneous Magnetisation]] we were after.

Indeed, in the absence of an applied field we have the equation,

$$
M = N \mu_B \tanh\(
	\frac{\mu_B  \lambda \mu_0 M}{k_BT}
\)
$$

which we can simplify to,

$$
m = \tanh\frac mt
$$

where $t = \frac{T}{T_C}$ and $m = \frac{M}{N\mu_B}$ is the [[Reduced Magnetisation]] the [[Magnetisation]] measured with respect to the [[Saturation Magnetisation]], aka the maximum value of the [[Magnetisation]]. 

Thus rephrasing this to $tx = \tanh x, x = \frac mt$ we can plot the following graph,

![[Pasted image 20210507162716.png]]

where we can see that for $t < 1$ (ie $T < T_C$) there is a non-zero solution, which tends to $m = 1 \implies M = N\mu_B$ in this case. This lines up with observed results,

### [[Magnetic Domains]]

This would imply however that Iron for example, which has a [[Curie Temperature]] $T_C > 1000\unit{K}$ would always be a permanent magnet at room temperature, this however is not the case. It is however still effected by other magnets and can be magnetised by a strong magnetic field.

We saw before that the dipole-dipole interactions are too weak to explain the [[Spontaneous Magnetisation]], instead we needed the Exchange Interaction. However this dipole-dipole interaction is much longer range than the Exchange Interaction which can only really effect the neighbouring atoms. Because of this, when summed over a large number of spins, it becomes relevant again.

In fact it gives rise to the macroscopic Magnetisation of a material, where as the Exchange Interaction governs local [[Magnetic Order]]. This macroscopic Magnetisation leads to [[Magnetic Domains]], a few examples of which are shown below.

![[Pasted image 20210507163703.png]]

From the above,

- The energy in (b) is lower than (a) because large numbers of spins reducing the small dipolar energy across the body of the domain, outweighs the small number of spins with increased exchange energy at the domain boundary.
- The energy is further reduced in (c) by the addition or more domains and further disorder.

These domains can be effected by the introduction of a strong external magnetic field.

![[Pasted image 20210507164042.png]]

- In (a) the sample is unmagnetised, this is natural iron.
- In (b) a weak field favouring spin up is applied.
	- This leads to the spin-up domains growing.
- In (c) an even stronger field causes domain rotation.

Strong fields cause irreversible domain changes, so that after removal of the applied field the [[Magnetisation]] does not return to the original state, leading to a [[Hysteresis]] curve.

Imperfections/defects in the crystal can **pin domains**, so that *without a strong field in the opposite direction it is hard for the spins to return to their original state*.
