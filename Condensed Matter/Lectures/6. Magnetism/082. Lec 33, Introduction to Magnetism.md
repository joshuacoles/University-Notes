Three types of Magnetism

- [[Ferromagnetism]], Permanent Magnets
- [[Paramagnetism]], paperclips
- [[Diamagnetism]], graphite

The origins are from:

- Moving charges (eg. currents in wire, atomic currents from orbiting electrons)
- Fundamental [[Magnetic Moment]] of elementary particles, determined by their spin.

These generate [[Magnetic Field|Magnetic Fields]] $\B$ which can be measured by its influence on moving charges (eg. the [[Hall Effect]]).

## [[Magnetisation]]

A Magnetic solid can be thought of as consisting of many *permanent* or *induced* [[Magnetic Dipole|Magnetic Dipoles]] with [[Dipole Moment|Dipole Moments]] $\mu_i$. 

The [[Magnetisation]] $\vM$ is the **average magnetic moment per unit volume**, 

$$
\vM = \frac 1V \sum_i \mu_i
$$

and creates an average [[Magnetic Field]], 

$$
\B_\vM = \mu_0 \vM
$$

where $\mu_0$ is the [[Permeability of Free Space]].

## Induced [[Magnetisation]]

The [[Magnetisation]] of a solid is often induced by an external [[Magnetic Field]] $\B_0$ which for weak fields is often a linear relation,

$$
\B_\vM = \chi \B_0 \implies M\vM = \chi \frac{\B_0}{}
$$
