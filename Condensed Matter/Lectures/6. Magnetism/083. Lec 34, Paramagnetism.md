## [[Paramagnetism]]

Paramagnetism occurs in the steel paperclip and is associated with the ordering of otherwise unordered [[Magnetic Dipole|Magnetic Dipoles]] when placed in an external [[Magnetic Field]]. It is a positive [[Magnetic Susceptability]] $\chi > 0$.

We consider two models that account for [[Magnetic Dipole|Magnetic Dipoles]] in materials:

- [[Curie Paramagnetism]], a model based on magnetic momentum associated with the atoms in the solid
- [[Pauli Paramagnetism]], accounts for the Paramagnetism associated with the conduction electrons in the crystal.

In the absence of a [[Magnetic Field]] the [[Magnetic Dipole|dipoles]] within the material are randomly aligned and thus,

$$
\langle\vec{\mu_i}\rangle = \vec0
$$

having no overall [[Magnetisation]]. However applying an external [[Magnetic Field]] this applies a [[Torque]] the magnetic moments tending to align them with the material and hence,

$$
\langle\vec{\mu_i}\rangle \ne \vec0.
$$

This is shown below

Note that this order will be opposed by thermal fluctuations which tend to decrease order.

## Atomic Theory of Paramagnetism

Consider a solid containing atoms with permanent [[Magnetic Dipole|Magnetic Dipoles]], lacking an external [[Magnetic Field]] these are randomly aligned with

$$ \langle\vec{\mu_i}\rangle = 0 \implies \vM = \vec{0}. $$

Again with an external magnetic field this applies a [[Torque]] $\vec\tau = \mu \cp \B_0$, tending to align $\vec\mu$ and $\B_0$, giving us a non-vanishing $\vM$ parallel with $\B_0$. In this model we assume the solid is made up of atoms with atomic moments,

$$
\mu = -g \mu_B \vJ
$$

where:

- $\hbar \vJ = \hbar \vL + \hbar \vS$ is the Total Angular Momentum of the atom, the sum of orbital and spin components.
- $\mu_B$ is the [[Bohr Magneton]].
- $g = 1 + \frac{J(J+1) + S(S + 1) - L(L + 1)}{2J(J+1)}$ is the [[Laund√© g-factor]].
- $J_z$ is quantised, $m_J \in [-J, J]_\Z$.
