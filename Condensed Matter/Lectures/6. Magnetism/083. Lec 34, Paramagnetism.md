## [[Paramagnetism]]

Paramagnetism occurs in the steel paperclip and is associated with the ordering of otherwise unordered [[Magnetic Dipole|Magnetic Dipoles]] when placed in an external [[Magnetic Field]]. It is a positive [[Magnetic Susceptability]] $\chi > 0$.

We consider two models that account for [[Magnetic Dipole|Magnetic Dipoles]] in materials:

- [[Curie Paramagnetism]], a model based on magnetic momentum associated with the atoms in the solid
- [[Pauli Paramagnetism]], accounts for the Paramagnetism associated with the conduction electrons in the crystal.

In the absence of a [[Magnetic Field]] the [[Magnetic Dipole|dipoles]] within the material are randomly aligned and thus,

$$
\langle\vec{\mu_i}\rangle = \vec0
$$

having no overall [[Magnetisation]]. However applying an external [[Magnetic Field]] this applies a [[Torque]] the magnetic moments tending to align them with the material and hence,

$$
\langle\vec{\mu_i}\rangle \ne \vec0.
$$

This is shown below

Note that this order will be opposed by thermal fluctuations which tend to decrease order.

## Atomic Theory of Paramagnetism

Consider a solid containing atoms with permanent [[Magnetic Dipole|Magnetic Dipoles]], lacking an external [[Magnetic Field]] these are randomly aligned with

$$ \langle\vec{\mu_i}\rangle = 0 \implies \vM = \vec{0}. $$

Again with an external magnetic field this applies a [[Torque]] $\vec\tau = \mu \cp \B_0$, tending to align $\vec\mu$ and $\B_0$, giving us a non-vanishing $\vM$ parallel with $\B_0$. In this model we assume the solid is made up of atoms with atomic moments,

$$
\mu = -g \mu_B \vJ
$$

where:

- $\hbar \vJ = \hbar \vL + \hbar \vS$ is the Total Angular Momentum of the atom, the sum of orbital and spin components.
- $\mu_B$ is the [[Bohr Magneton]].
- $g = 1 + \frac{J(J+1) + S(S + 1) - L(L + 1)}{2J(J+1)}$ is the [[LandÃ© g-factor]].
- $J_z$ is quantised, $m_J \in [-J, J]_{\Z \'{ step}}$.

## Quantum Theory of Paramagnetism

What happens when the [[Atomic Moment]] is placed in an plied magnetic field? The energy of the quantum moment in a field $\B_0 = B\uvec{e}_z$.

$$
U = - \vec\mu \dp \B_0 = m_j g \mu_B B
$$

^energy

where $m_J$ is the projection of $\vJ$ along the $\uvec{e}_z$ axis and is quantised to $[-J, J]_{\Z \'{ step}}$. The state $m_J = -J$ is the state of minimum energy.

In the simplest case of no Orbital momentum $L = 0$, single spin $S = \frac12$. Then $J = \frac12, m_J = \pm\frac12$, $g = 2$ (no L) and hence $U = \pm \mu_BB$. These are displayed on an energy level diagram below:

![[Pasted image 20210506193533.png]]

where $\epsi_1, \epsi_2$ are measured relative to the vacuum energy state. 

These two states have probabilities given by,

$$
p_1 = \frac1Z \expp{+\mu_BB\over k_BT}
\qquad
p_1 = \frac1Z \expp{-\mu_BB\over k_BT}
$$

where $Z$ is the [[Parition Function]] for this [[Two State System]] which normalises these values. This gives an average moment of the atom as,

$$
\langle \mu \rangle = \mu_1p_1 + \mu_2p_2 = +\mu_B p_1 - \mu_B p_2 = \mu_B \tanh\({\mu_BB \over k_BT}\)
$$

giving us a [[Magnetisation]] of $\vM = N\langle\mu\rangle = N\mu_B \tanh\({\mu_BB \over k_BT}\)$ for $N$ per unit volume. Plotted below as,

![[Pasted image 20210506194215.png]]

as you can see for weak fields $M \propto B$ and hence we have [[Curie's Law]]  of $\chi = \frac{C}{T}$ where $C = {N\mu_B^2 \over k_B}$ is [[Curie's Constant]]  and $M = \chi B$. Further this saturates at a maximum value of $N\mu_B$. We can see that [[Paramagnetism]] gets weaker at higher $T$.

> We can show that [[Magnetisation]] in the $x, y$ directions is zero.

We can see the accuracy shown in the graphs below

## Paramagnetism of Conduction Electrons

The theory above however does not account for free electrons. Initially one might assume there to be a relation similar to [[Curie's Law]] with,

$$
M = \frac{N \mu_B^2}{k_BT}B
$$

for $N$ conduction electrons per unit volume. However in non-[[Ferromagnetism|Ferromagnetic]] materials this is found to be much smaller and temperature independent, for reasons similar to that we saw in [[053. Lec 20, Sommerfeld model, Heat capacity]].

Conduction electrons occupy states labeled with by [[Wave Vector]] $\vk$ and a spin $s = \pm \frac12$. The electron can only align its own moment with that of the external field if that state is unoccupied ([[Pauli Exclusion Principle]]) and hence the state must have energy near the "interesting region" ($\sim k_BT$) of the [[Fermi-Dirac Distribution]]. Only a fraction $\frac{T}{T_F}$ are within this region and hence the [[Magnetisation]] is in fact, 

$$
M \simeq \frac{N \mu_B^2 B}{k_BT} \frac{T}{T_F} = \frac{N \mu_B^2 B}{k_BT_F}
$$

noting that we lose the temperature dependence and have a much smaller magnitude.

### Quantitative Look ([mn](marginnote3app://note/91F7892A-963D-41D9-B86B-00AB9572B9DF))

States with spins aligned with an external magnetic field will have an energy offset down by [[083. Lec 34, Paramagnetism#^energy]], and those opposing up by the same amount. Hence, dispalying the occupation graphs for these two cases (top aligned, bottom unaligned) we see,

![[Pasted image 20210506200103.png]]

where there is a clear excess of states with aligned spins (as states are filled according to their energies). This leads to an excess and thus [[Magnetisation]] of, 

$$
M = \mu_B (N_{up} - N_{down}) \simeq \mu_B^2 B\,g(e_F)
$$

![[Pasted image 20210506200346.png]]
```

this leads to (with maths given above),

$$
M = \frac32 \frac{N \mu_B^2 B}{k_BT_F}
$$

In real metals this result requires corrections due to the band properties of electrons and interactions between electrons unaccounted for in this model.
