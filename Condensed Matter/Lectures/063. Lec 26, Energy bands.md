For [[Free Electrons]] (eg. in [[Sommerfeld Theory]]), the potential is given as,

$$
\epsi = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}.
$$

If the [[Periodic Potential]] in the crystal negligible, we would expect it to have very little effect on the electron energies and for this to apply even when taking the [[Crystal Lattice]] into account.

However none of the reasoning in [[062. Lec 25, Bloch's theorem]] was dependent on the strength of the potential applied. Thus this should have no effect on:

- [[Bloch's Theorem]]
- The periodicity of the [[Wave Function]] in the [[Wave Vector]].

This means that electrons with [[Wave Function|Wave Functions]] outside of the [[Brillouin Zone]] are still equivalent to those within it with their [[Reduced Wave Vector]], and thus the energy-wave vector relationship must also be periodic.

To understand the behaviour when we add a non-negligible potential, we will focus on the waves with [[Wave Vector]] $k = \pm \frac\pi a$ as these states are [[Degenerate]], appearing in two different curves (Band Index branches?) with the same [[Wave Vector]] and thus energy (hence degenerate).
