For [[Free Electrons]] (eg. in [[Sommerfeld Theory]]), the potential is given as,

$$
\epsi = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}.
$$

If the [[Periodic Potential]] in the crystal negligible, we would expect it to have very little effect on the electron energies and for this to apply even when taking the [[Crystal Lattice]] into account.

However none of the reasoning in [[062. Lec 25, Bloch's theorem]] was dependent on the strength of the potential applied. Thus this should have no effect on:

- [[Bloch's Theorem]]
- The periodicity of the [[Wave Function]] in the [[Wave Vector]].

This means that electrons with [[Wave Function|Wave Functions]] outside of the [[Brillouin Zone]] are still equivalent to those within it with their [[Reduced Wave Vector]], and thus the
