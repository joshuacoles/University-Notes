## [[Energy Bands]]

For [[Free Electrons]] (eg. in [[Sommerfeld Theory]]), the potential is given as,

$$
\epsi = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}.
$$

### Weak Limit

If the [[Periodic Potential]] in the crystal negligible, we would expect it to have very little effect on the electron energies. However none of the reasoning in [[062. Lec 25, Bloch's theorem]] was dependent on the
