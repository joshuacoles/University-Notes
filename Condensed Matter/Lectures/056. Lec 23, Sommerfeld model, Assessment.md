The [[Sommerfeld Theory]] can be seen an extension of the [[Drude Model]], fixing some but not all of its problems. These include,

- We have now accounted for the temperature dependence of the [[Resistivity]] (cf [[055. Lec 22, Sommerfeld model, Conduction & scattering#Resistivity in the Sommerfeld Theory]]).
- But we have not advanced our understanding of the magnitude of the [[Mean Free Path]] as we have not introduced the ions into the calculation.
- We have corrected the [[Heat Capacity]] calculations, specifically its lack of dependence on the electrons (cf [[053. Lec 20, Sommerfeld model, Heat capacity]]).
- The [[Lorenz Number]] is now correctly predicted (cf [[054. Lec 21, Sommerfeld model, Thermal conductivity]]).
- We can now explain sample dependence of some properties ([[055. Lec 22, Sommerfeld model, Conduction & scattering]]). 
- But we cannot explain the [[Anisotrophy]] seen with some materials and properties without the use of the ionic lattice.
- In addition we cannot account for optical or alloy properties.
- [[Paramagnetism]] will be discussed later but is explained within the model.
