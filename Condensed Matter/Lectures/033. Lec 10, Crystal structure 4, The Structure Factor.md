## [[Reciprocal Lattice]] with arbitrary [[Crystal Basis]]

In [[031. Lec 8, Crystal structure 4, Reciprocal Lattice, Prelude#From all atoms]] we considered only the [[Unitary Crystal Basis]]. Here we expand our calculations to bases of more complex nature.

This is done by noting that the number of atoms in a cell is countable and finite and thus can be identified with the pair, $j = (J, \mu) \in \N \cp J_M$ where $\mu$ $J$ is the unit cell, and $\mu$ the atom within it ($M$ being a bound on the complexity of the unit cell). This leads to atomic vectors of the form,

$$
\r_j = \vec{R}_J + \r_\mu,
$$

and an amplitude of,

$$
\begin{align*}
A(\vec{Q}) &=
C \sum_{J, \mu} f_\mu \exp{\( -i\vec{Q} \dp \(\vec{R}_J + \r_\mu\) \)} \\

&=
C
\sum_{J} \exp{\( -i\vec{Q} \dp \vec{R}_J\)} \times
\sum_{\mu} f_\mu \exp{\( -i\vec{Q} \dp \r_\mu\)}
\cdot
\end{align*}
$$

> Note that the atomic form factor is dependent on $\mu$, ie. the specific atom in the basis, not on $J$, which Basis Cell it is contained within. This is an extension of the formula seen in [[031. Lec 8, Crystal structure 4, Reciprocal Lattice, Prelude#From all atoms]]

Thus giving us,
$$
A(\vec{Q}) = \begin{cases}
C N_{cells} \times S(\vec{Q}) &\quad\text{if Laue Conditions satisfied} \\
0 &\quad\text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
$$

where $S(\vec{Q})$ is the affect of the [[Crystal Basis]] on the diffraction pattern, given (unsurprisingly) as,

$$
S(\vec{Q}) = \sum_\mu f_\mu \exp{\( -i\vec{Q} \dp \r_\mu\)}.
$$

This influences the **relative intensities** of the diffraction pattern. It is known as the [[Structure Factor]].

> Remember as $I \propto A^2 \implies I \propto S^2$.

Since it only has an effect when the [[Laue Conditions]] are satisfied, we can limit our evaluations of it to when $\vec{Q} \in \vec{G}_{hkl}$, denoted as $S_{hkl} = S(\vec{G}_{hkl})$. Evaluating the [[Structure Factor]] at these points, we get need pay interest to the expression $\vQ \dp \r$ and subsequently the general form

$$
\vv_i \dp \vV_i
$$

where $v_i$ and $V_i$ are the [[Primitive Lattice Vectors]] and [[Primitive Reciprocal Lattice Vectors]] respectively. Recalling from the definition of [[Primitive Reciprocal Lattice Vectors]] (given at [[032. Lec 9, Crystal structure 4, The Reciprocal Lattice#Reciprocal Lattice]], we have,

$$
\begin{align*}
\vv_i \dp \vV_i
&= \vv_i \dp \frac {2\pi (\vv_{i+1} \cp \vv_{i+2})}{\vv_1 \dp (\vv_2 \cp \vv_3)} \\
&= 2\pi \frac {\vv_i \dp (\vv_{i+1} \cp \vv_{i+2})}{\vv_1 \dp (\vv_2 \cp \vv_3)} \\
&= 2\pi \dp 1 \\
&= 2\pi
\end{align*}
$$

Thus now applying this to vectors $\vQ = \vG_{hkl}, \r = (u, v, w)$ (ie at atom at fractional coordinates $u,v,w$),

$$
\begin{align*}
\vQ \dp \r = \vG_{hkl} \dp (u, v, w)_{\va\vb\vc} &= 2\pi h u + 2\pi k v + 2\pi l w 
\\&= 2\pi (hu + kv + lw)
\end{align*}
$$

hence,

$$
S(\vG_{hkl}) = \sum_\mu f_\mu \exp\(-2\pi i \(hu + kv + lw\)\).
$$

## Examples of [[Structure Factor]]

Illuminating examples of this are the difference between [[Body Centered Cubic Crystal Structure]] and [[Cesium Chloride Crystal Structure]].

### [[Cesium Chloride Crystal Structure]]

![[Pasted image 20210322173804.png]]

Here we see evaluating the [[Structure Factor]] over the [[Primitive Unit Cell]] given we get,

$$
\begin{align*}
S_{hkl}
&= \sum_\mu f_\mu \exp\(-2\pi i \(hu + kv + lw\)\) \\
&= f_{\ce{Cs}} \exp\(-2\pi i \(h\dp0 + k\dp0 + l\dp0\)\) 
\\&\qquad + f_{\ce{Cl}} \exp\(-2\pi i \(h\dp \frac12 + k\dp\frac12 + l\dp\frac12\)\) \\

&= f_{\ce{Cs}} + f_{\ce{Cl}} \exp\(-\pi i \(h + k + l\)\) \\
\end{align*}
$$

This can be further simplified by remembering that $\exp{i\theta}$ is periodic $2\pi i$ and thus since $h,k,l$ are all integers we need only consider the cases when $h + k + l$ are *even* or *odd*. Corrosponding to the following:

- *Even*: $S_{hkl} = f_{\ce{Cs}} + f_{\ce{Cl}}$
- *Odd*: $S_{hkl} = f_{\ce{Cs}} - f_{\ce{Cl}}$

This is actually the behaviour we already observed in [[024. Lec 6, Crystal Structure 3, The basis#Example Cesium Chloride Crystal Structure]]. Remembering again that $I \propto A^2 \sim S^2$.

### [[Body Centered Cubic Crystal Structure]]

Contrasting this to [[Body Centered Cubic Crystal Structure]], we have,

![[Pasted image 20210322175518.png]]

which from structural considerations leads to the same form accept,

- *$h+k+l \sim$ Even*: $S_{hkl} = f + f = 2f$
- *$h+k+l \sim$ Odd*: $S_{hkl} = f - f = 0$

This explains the extinction of certain lines in going from [[Simple Cubic Crystal Structure]] to [[Body Centered Cubic Crystal Structure]],
