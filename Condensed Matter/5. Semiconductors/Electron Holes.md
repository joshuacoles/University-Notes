# Electron Holes
> cf [[072. Lec 30, Semiconductors, holes and EOM]]

Electron holes are used to model the absence of an electron in the [[Valence Band]] after it has been thermally excited to the [[Conduction Band]]. They can be conceptually explained with the relation,

$$
\begin{gather}
\text{Band of $N$ electrons} - n \text{ electrons} \\\equiv\\
\text{Full Inert Band of $N$ electrons} + n \text{ holes}
\end{gather}
$$

## Properties ([*mn*](marginnote3app://note/255B7887-A683-4C5D-9F6B-C53B313CFBA7))

Holes have the following properties related to the electron state they obscure.

- Charge $q_h = -q_e = +e$
- [[Wave Vector]] $\vk_h = -\vk_e$
- [[Effective Mass]] $m_h^* = -m_v^*$
	- Note that $m_h^* > 0$ as Holes exist in the [[Valence Band]] which has a **negative** [[Effective Mass]].
- Energy $\epsi_h = - \epsi_e =  \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_h^*}$
	- Note this is **positive** and is equal to negative of the electron energy due to the sign of the effective mass and the curvature of the [[Valence Band]].
- Velocity, $\vv_h = \vv_e$
	- Considering the effect of the negated charge on the current flow, a positive charge in one direction, is equal to the removal of a negative in the same.
