Bloch's theorem states that solutions to the [[Schr√∂dinger Equation]] in a [[Periodic Potential]] take the form of a [[Plane Wave]] multiplied by a periodic function, given the form,

$$
\psi_{n,\vk}(\r) = \exp(i \vk \dp \r) \dp u(\r)
$$

these are known as [[Bloch Wave|Bloch Waves]]. These functions form a basis of the [[Hilbert Space]] of [[Wave Function|Wave Functions]]. The $n$
