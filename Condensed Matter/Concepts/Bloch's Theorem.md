Bloch's theorem states that solutions to the [[Schr√∂dinger Equation]] in a [[Periodic Potential]] take the form of a [[Plane Wave]] multiplied by a periodic function, given the form,

$$
\psi_{n,\vk}(\r) = \exp(i \vk \dp \r) \dp u(\r)
$$

where $n$ is the [[Band Index]], distinguishing the many wave functions of the same [[Wave Vector]], each with a different periodic component in $u$ (that last bit was ripped from the Wiki, pls expand #todo).

These [[Wave Function|Wave Functions]] are known as [[Bloch Wave|Bloch Waves]] and form a basis solutions for the constructed system.
