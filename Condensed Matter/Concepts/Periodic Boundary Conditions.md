[[Periodic Boundary Conditions]] is an extension of the normal [[Square Well]] boundary conditions imposed upon a [[Wave Function]][^1]. In this model we impose the stronger condition that,

$$
\psi(\r + \vec{R}) = \psi(\r) \quad\forall \vec{R} \in L
$$

where $L$ determines the periodicity of the solution. Normally $L$ will be given by the **integer span** of a set of [[Primitive Lattice Vector]]. If $L$ is a continuous set, then $\psi$ must be constant along it's span.

[^1]: See the diagram below, given mathematically as,
	$$ \begin{gather}
	\psi : [0, L] \to \C \\\\
	\psi(0) = 0 \\
	\psi(L) = 0
	\end{gather} $$

## Application to Potential Free Systems (aka quantisation of the [[Wave Vector]]  in [[Plane Wave|Plane Waves]])

If we restrict ourselves to 3D systems with a zero potential, given by the [[Time Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation]]:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nab^2 \psi = E\psi,
$$

we obtain the [[Plane Wave]] solution,

$$
\psi(\r) = A\exp(i\vk \dp \r).
$$

We can impose a boundary condition representing the [[Crystal Lattice]] generated by the [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] $\va, \vb, \vc$, ie that,

$$
\psi(\r + n_1 \va + n_2 \vb + n_3 \vc) = \psi(\r) \quad\Forall n_1,n_2,n_3\in\Z.
$$

which gives us a constraint on $\vk$ of the form,

$$
\begin{align*}
\psi(\r) &= \psi(\r + \vec{R}) \\
A\exp(i\vk \dp \r) &= A\exp(i\vk \dp (\r + \vec{R})) \\

A\exp(i\vk \dp \r) &= 
A\exp(i\vk \dp \r)
 \exp(i\vk \dp \vec{R}) \\

1 &= \exp(i\vk \dp \vec{R}) \\\\

\implies\quad
\vk \dp \vec{R} &=  2\pi n
\end{align*}
$$

which we can identify as the [[Laue Conditions]]. Since this is true over the entire integer span of the [[Primitive Lattice Vector]] this is equivalent to,

$$
\begin{gather}
\vk \dp \vec{a} = 2\pi m_1, \\
\vk \dp \vec{b} = 2\pi m_2, \\
\vk \dp \vec{c} = 2\pi m_3. \\
\end{gather}
$$

Hence we know that $\vk$ **can only take a discrete set of values**, ie that it is a member of the [[Reciprocal Lattice]], given by the *integer span* of the [[Primitive Reciprocal Lattice Vectors]] $\vA, \vB, \vC$.

#todo is any of what we just wrote right??
