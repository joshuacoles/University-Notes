# Magnetism

- All materials experience [[Diamagnetism]] which is due to the affects of an external magnetic field on the orbiting electrons (cf [[091. Lec 35, Diamagnetism]]).
- However this is overshadowed by the effects of Permanent Dipoles leading to [[Paramagnetism]] if present (cf [[083. Lec 34, Paramagnetism]]).
	- This is due to incomplete shells leading to Spin and Orbital dipoles leading to [[Atomic Moment]].
	- As well as the conduction electrons.
		- From my own thoughts I do not believe that the former applies to [[Semiconductors]] as they should have yielded their electrons to the sea, I think.
		- How do [[Energy Bands]] related to [[Electron Orbitials]].
- If there is [[Magnetic Order]] caused by the [[Exchange Interaction]] then a [[Magnetisation]] can exist independently of an external field, however it can be changed by it (cf [[092. Lec 36, Ferromagnetism]]).
	- This comes about through the same routes as [[083. Lec 34, Paramagnetism#Quantum Theory of Paramagnetism]] [[092. Lec 36, Ferromagnetism#The Exchange Interaction]].
