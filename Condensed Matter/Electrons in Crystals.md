# Electrons in Crystals

Start with [[Drude Model]],

![[042. Lec 12, Electrons in solids, Drude model#Assumptions]]

then make it quantum in the [[051. Lec 18, Electrons in solids, The Sommerfeld model]]

![[051. Lec 18, Electrons in solids, The Sommerfeld model#Comparison of Drude Model to Sommerfeld Theory]].

![[051. Lec 18, Electrons in solids, The Sommerfeld model#Lattice of Quantised Wave Vectors Fermi Sphere]]

Then we add a periodic potential [[062. Lec 25, Bloch's theorem]] leading to [[Bloch Wave|Bloch Waves]] which have wave vectors in the [[Brillouin Zone]] and discrete points of period $\frac {2\pi}a$

![[062. Lec 25, Bloch's theorem#1D Case Simplification]]

This also leads to [[063. Lec 26, Energy bands]]

![[063. Lec 26, Energy bands]]

Which goes to [[5. Semiconductors|Semiconductor]]
