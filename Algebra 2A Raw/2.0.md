### Chapter 2 Sums and quotients

We will discuss various ways of building new vector spaces out of old ones.

###### Convention

. In this chapter, all vector spaces are over the same field $\F$ unless we say otherwise.

#### 2.1 Sums of subspaces

###### Definition

. Let $\lst {V}1k\leq V$. The _sum_ $\plst {V}1k$ is the set

$\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

$$ \plst {V}1k:=\set {\plst {v}1k\st v_i\in V_i, 1\leq i\leq k}. $$

$\plst {V}1k$ is the smallest subspace of $V$ that contains each $V_i$. More precisely:

- [[Proposition 2.1]]. Let $\lst {V}1k\leq V$. Then

  - (1) $\plst {V}1k\leq V$.
  - (2) If $W\leq V$ and $\lst {V}1k\leq W$ then $\lst {V}1k\leq \plst {V}1k\leq W$.

- Proof. It suffices to prove (2) since (1) then follows by taking $W=V$.

  For (2), first note that $\plst {V}1k$ is a subset of $W$: if $v_i\in V_i$ then $v_i\in W$ so that $\plst {v}1k\in W$ since $W$ is closed under addition.

  Now observe that each $V_i\leq \plst {V}1k$ since we can write any $v_i\in V_i$ as $0+\dots +v_i+\dots +0\in \plst {V}1k$. In particular, $0\in \plst {V}1k$.

  Finally, we show that $\plst {V}1k$ is a subspace. If $\plst {v}1k,\plst {w}1k\in \plst {V}1k$, with $v_i,w_i\in V_i$, for all $i$, and $\lambda \in \F$ then

  $\seteqnumber{0}{2.}{0}$

  $$ (\plst {v}1k)+\lambda (\plst {w}1k)=\plus {(v_1+\lambda w_1)}{(v_k+\lambda w_k)}\in \plst {V}1k $$

  since each $v_i+\lambda w_i\in V_i$. â–¡

- Remark. The union $\bigcup _{i=1}^kV_{i}$ is almost never a subspace of $V$ so we use sums as a substitute for unions in Linear Algebra.
