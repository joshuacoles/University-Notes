# Solving the Heat Equation

In [[15.1 Physical Derivation of the Heat Equation]] we derived an equation describing the flow of heat along a 1D bar as,

$$
\frac{\p u}{\p t} = \kappa \frac{\p^2 u}{\p x^2},
$$

^1d-heat-eq

where $\kappa = k/(\rho c)$ is the [[Thermal Diffusivity]], and $u = u(x,t)$ is the temperature. We then define a, [[14.22 Dirichlet Boundary Condition|Dirichlet Boundary Problem]]:  

Let $u(x, t) : [0, L] \cp \mathbb{T}^+ \to \R^+$ then,

1. PDE, $u_t = \kappa u_{xx}$ ^pde
2. Boundary Conditions, $0 = u(0, t) = u(L, t)$ ^boundary-conditions
3. Initial Conditions, $f(x) = u(x, 0)$ ^initial-conditions

^sys

which models the heat distribution in the 1D bar when the temperature at the ends is fixed at zero (hence why it is a [[14.25 Homogeneous & Inhomogeneous Boundary Conditions|Homogeneous boundary condition]]) and the bar begins at the initial temperature $f(x)$.

We will solve this through [[Separation of Variables]], giving us,

$$
u(x, t) = X(x) G(t)
$$

## Fourier Series Solution for Heat Equation

> #todo should we move [[10.4 Motivation for Fourier Series from Heat Equation]] into here?

We recall from [[10.4 Motivation for Fourier Series from Heat Equation]] that we previously derived,

![[10.4 Motivation for Fourier Series from Heat Equation#^eq-10-30]]

where $\lambda _n = \frac{\pi n}{L}$. Imposing the [[#^initial-conditions|initial conditions]] we obtain,

$$
f(x) = \sum _{n=1}^\infty B_n \sin \left (\frac {\pi n x}{L}\right ).
$$

^eq-15-4

which we can reconise as a [[Fourier Sine Series]] over the interval $x \in [0, L]$. 

Thus we can apply [[12.7 Fourier Coefficients for General Periodic Function]] to obtain expressions for the coefficients $B_n$ by considering the [[12.8 Even and Odd Periodic Extensions|Odd Periodic Extension]] of $f(x)$ from $[0, L]$ to $[-L, L]$.

$$
B_n = \frac {2}{L}\int_{0}^{L}
	f(x) \sin\(\frac {n\pi x}{L}\)
\rd x.
$$

### Summary

In summary: a solution of [[#^sys|system]] above is,
