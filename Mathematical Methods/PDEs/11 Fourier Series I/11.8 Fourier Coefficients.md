# Fourier coefficients

^7fc577

Given that we can represent a [[11.1 Periodic Function|Periodic Function]] with period $2\pi$ $f : \R \to \R$ by the [[Fourier Series]],

![[11 Fourier Series I#^eq-11-3]]

we can determine the coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ by expressions,

$$
\begin{align}
a_n &= \frac {1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \cos(nx) \rd x \\
b_n &= \frac {1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \sin(nx) \rd x \\
\end{align}
$$

Further we say if these integrals exist, then a function $f$ can be represented by the Fourier Series with those coefficients.

In the more general case of a [[11.1 Periodic Function|Periodic Function]] $g : \R \to \R$ with period $2L$ we say its coefficients are,

$$
\begin{align}
a_n &= \frac {1}{L} \int_{-L}^{L} g(x) \cos(nx) \rd x \\
b_n &= \frac {1}{L} \int_{-L}^{L} g(x) \sin(nx) \rd x \\
\end{align}
$$

obtained by considering the composition,

$$
g'(x) = g\(x \dp \frac{L}{\pi}\)
$$

which *is* a $2\pi$ Periodic Function.


## Derivation

Starting from the general Fourier Series expression seen above,

![[11 Fourier Series I#^eq-11-3]]

with the aim of applying the [[11.7 Orthogonality Lemma|Orthogonality Lemma]] we integrate the product $f(x)\cos(nx)$,

$$
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \cos(nx) \rd x
= \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \(
	\frac {a_0}{2} + \sum_{m \in \N} (
		a_m \cos(mx) 
	  + b_m \sin(mx)
	 )
   \) \cos(nx) \rd x. \\
$$

which we can split into three terms (on the assumption the summation commutes with the integral #todo under what conditions? Probably convergence, ie that the series is well define),

$$
\begin{align}
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \cos(nx) \rd x

&= \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac {a_0}{2} \cos(nx) \rd x \\

&+ \sum_{m \in \N} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} a_m \cos(mx)\cos(nx) \rd x \\

&+ \sum_{m \in \N} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} b_m \sin(mx)\cos(nx) \rd x \\
\end{align}
$$

where the behaviour of each is dependent on $n$, $m$ and their relation.

### Case 1: $n \ne 0$

If $n\neq 0$ then,
    
$$
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac {a_0}{2} \cos(nx) \rd x = 0,
$$

and by the [[11.7 Orthogonality Lemma]] we can write the 1st sum term as,

$$
\sum_{m \in \N}
a_m \int _{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos(mx) \cos(nx) \rd x = \sum a_m \delta_{mn} = \pi a_n
$$

with the 2nd going to $0$ by the same lemma. Therefore 

$$
a_n = \frac {1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \cos(nx) \rd x.
$$

### Case 2: $n = 0$

Starting again from the 3 term sum: both the 2nd and 3rd terms will be zero as $n \notin \N \implies n \ne m$, meaning we need only focus on the first term where

$$
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{a_0}{2} \cos(0 \dp x) \rd x = 2\pi \dp \frac{a_0}{2} = \pi a_0
$$

and hence,

$$
a_0 = \frac {1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \cos(0\dp x) \rd x.
$$

as needed.

### Sine components

The same logic applies multiplying by $\sin(nx)$ for $b_n$.

## Even and Odd Functions

In the case that $f(x)$ is either [[11.4 Even Function|Even]] or [[11.3 Odd Function|Odd]] we can apply [[11.5 Properties of Even and Odd Functions]], to restrict the domain required for the integration. 

### Even

If $f(x)$ is [[11.4 Even Function|Even]], then $b_n=0$ for all $n$, and so

$$
f(x) = \frac {a_0}{2} + \sum_{n \in \N} a_n \cos (nx)
$$

where

$$
a_n = \frac {2}{\pi }\int _0^\pi f(x) \cos (nx) \rd {x}.
$$
^eq-11-19

### Odd

If $f(x)$ is [[11.3 Odd Function|Odd]] then $a_n=0$ for all $n$, and so

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n \in \N} b_n \sin (nx),
$$

where

$$
b_n = \frac {2}{\pi}\int_0^\pi f(x) \sin (nx) \rd {x}.
