#  Properties of Even and Odd Functions

Assuming the integrals below all exist:

## Behaviour of Continuous Odd Function at Zero

For a **continuous** odd function, $f(0) = 0$.

## Integral of Odd Function over Symmetric Domain

For an odd function $f$,

$$
\int_{-a}^a f(x) \rd x = 0,
$$

for any $a \in \R$.

## Integral of Even Function over Symmetric Domain

For an even function $g$,

$$
\int_{-a}^a g(x) \rd x = 2\int_0^a g(x) \rd x,
$$

for any $[[Exam Cheat Sheet]]a \in \R$.

## Behaviour of Pointwise Product of 

The pointwise product $f(x)g(x)$ of an odd and even function is odd. The product of two even functions is even. The product of two odd functions is even.
