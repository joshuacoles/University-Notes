# Solving Laplace's Equation with 4 Inhomogeneous Sides

The solution to [[Laplace's Equation]] in a square with non-zero Dirichlet conditions on each of the four sides is obtained by taking the [[14.8  Principle of superposition|Superposition]] of four solutions of the type found in [[17.2 Solving Laplace's Equation with 1 Inhomogeneous Side]]. So, given the system,

$$
\nab^2 u(x,y) = 0 \qquad \text {for} \quad (x,y)\in (0,L)\times (0,L)
$$

where


$$
u(x,0) = f_1(x), \quad u(0,y) = f_2(y), \quad u(x,L) = f_3(x), \quad u(L,y) = f_4(y).
$$

We can separate out each [[14.25 Homogeneous & Inhomogeneous Boundary Conditions|Inhomogeneous Boundary Conditions]] into its own solution $u_i$, and by the principle of superposition

$$ u(x,y)= u_1(x,y) + u_2(x,y) + u_3(x,y) + u_4(x,y), $$

where each of the individual $u_i$ solutions for $i = 1, 2, 3,  4$ satisfies the inhomogeneous condition corresponding to $f_i$, but homogeneous zero boundary conditions on the remaining three sides.

The first problem was solved in Theorem 17.2 and the other three can be solved in the same way. Splitting the problem into four separate problems can be viewed as following Step 0 of the separation of variables Algorithm 15.2 â€“ we zero as many boundary conditions as possible. In conclusion, the separation of variables algorithm yields


$$ \begin{align*} u_{1}(x,y) & = \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }B_{n}\sin \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right )\sinh \left (\frac {n\pi \left (L-y\right )}{L}\right ),\\ u_{2}(x,y) & = \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }A_{n}\sin \left (\frac {n\pi y}{L}\right )\sinh \left (\frac {n\pi \left (L-x\right )}{L}\right ),\\ u_{3}(x,y) & = \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }C_{n}\sin \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right )\sinh \left (\frac {n\pi y}{L}\right ),\\ u_{4}(x,y) & = \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }D_{n}\sin \left (\frac {n\pi y}{L}\right )\sinh \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right ), \end{align*} $$

 where the coefficients $B_n$ are defined by [[#^eq-17-11]] and


$$ \begin{align*} A_{n} & = \frac {2}{L\sinh \left (n\pi \right ) }\int _{0}^{L}f_2 (y)\sin \left (\frac {n\pi y}{L}\right )\,\mathrm {d}y,\\ C_{n} & = \frac {2}{L\sinh \left (n\pi \right ) }\int _{0}^{L}f_3 (x)\sin \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right )\,\mathrm {d}x,\\D_{n} & = \frac {2}{L\sinh \left (n\pi \right ) }\int _{0}^{L}f_4 (y)\sin \left (\frac {n\pi y}{L}\right )\,\mathrm {d}y.\\ \end{align*} $$
