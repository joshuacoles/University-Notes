# Piecewise Continuity

The function $f(x)$ is Piecewise Continuous on $(a, b)$ if we can divide $(a,b)$ into a finite number of subintervals where:

1. $f(x)$ is defined and [[Continuous]] on each
2. The Left Hand and Right Hand limits at the endpoints of each subinterval exist.

#todo this should also be moved with [[12.2 One-Sided Limits]]
