# One-Sided Limits

Suppose that $x$ approaches the point $c$ from the right. For the limiting value of $f(x)$ we write

$$
f(c_+) := \lim _{\substack {h\to 0 \\ h > 0}} f(c + h),
$$

if it exists, this the right hand limit of $f$ at $c$. 

Similarly, the left hand limit of $f(x)$ at $c$ is defined to be

$$
f(c_-) = \lim _{\substack {h\to 0 \\ h > 0}} f(c - h),
$$

if it exists.

## Example

For the square wave of example 12.1, $f(0_-) = -1$ and $f(0_+) = 1$.

## Further Development

#todo  to be superseded by analysis course.

## Remark, Existence

Functions need not always have left hand and right hand limits. For instance, $\sin (1/x)$, as $x\to 0$, has neither.
