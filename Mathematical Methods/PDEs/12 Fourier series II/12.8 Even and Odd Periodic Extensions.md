# Even and Odd Periodic Extensions

Given $f(x)$ defined on $x\in [0, L]$, its _even periodic extension_ is defined by

$$ f_e(x) = \begin {cases} f(x) & x \in [0, L], \\ f(-x) & x \in [-L, 0]. \end {cases} $$

so that we have $f_e(-x) = f_e(x)$ for $x\in [-L, L]$. Similarly its _odd periodic extension_ is defined by

$$ f_o(x) = \begin {cases} f(x) & x \in [0, L], \\ -f(-x) & x \in [-L, 0]. \end {cases} $$

so that we have $f_o(-x) = -f_o(x)$. Once both functions have been extended to $[-L, L]$, they can be further extended to a $2L$-periodic function over all $x$ in the usual way:

$$ f_e(x+2kL) = f_e(x) \quad \text { for }\, k\in \mathbb {Z}, \, x \in (-L,L), $$

and

$$ f_o(x+2kL) = f_o(x) \quad \text { for }\, k\in \mathbb {Z}, \, x \in (-L,L). $$

#### Example 12.9

.  Fig. 12.2 shows the the odd/even periodic extensions of $f(x)=x^2$.

Figure 12.2: The odd and even periodic extensions of $f(x)=x^2$ defined initially on $[0,L=\pi ]$.

Recall from lemma 11.9 that for an even function defined on $[-L, L]$, the Fourier coefficients $b_n$ vanish for all $n$. Thus for an even periodic extension,


$$
\begin{gathered} f_e(x) = \frac {a_{0}}{2}+\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } a_{n} \cos \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right ), \\ \text {where } a_n = \frac {2}{L}\int _{0}^{L} f(x) \cos \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right )\,\rd x, \qquad \text {$n \geq 0$}. \end {gathered} $$

Note that instead of writing $\int _{-L}^L \cdots$ we have written $2\int _0^L \cdots$, using the fact that the integrand is an even function.

Similarly for an odd extension,


$$
\begin{gathered} f_o(x) = \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } b_{n} \sin \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right ), \\ \text {where } b_n = \frac {2}{L}\int _{0}^{L} f(x) \sin \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right )\,\rd x, \qquad \text {$n \geq 1$}. \end {gathered}
$$

Again, instead of writing $\int _{-L}^L \cdots$ we have written $2\int _0^L \cdots$, using the fact that the integrand is again an even function (because it is the product of two odd functions).

#### Example 12.10

.  Construct the Fourier series of the periodic extension of $f(x)=\mathrm {e}^x$ on $[0,2\pi ]$.

**Solution:** Using Theorem 12.7 and Remark 12.2 with $L=\pi$, we have that

$$ a_n = \frac {1}{\pi }\int _{0}^{2\pi }\mathrm {e}^x \cos \left (nx\right )\, \mathrm {d}x \quad \text { and }\quad b_n = \frac {1}{\pi }\int _{0}^{2\pi }\mathrm {e}^x \sin \left (nx\right )\, \mathrm {d}x. $$

Recall the indefinite integrals (which you should check that you know how to derive)


$$ \begin{align}  & \int \mathrm {e}^{\alpha x} \cos \left (\beta x\right )\, \mathrm {d}x = \frac {1}{\alpha ^{2}+\beta ^{2}}\mathrm {e}^{\alpha x}\Big [\alpha \cos \left (\beta x\right )+\beta \sin \left (\beta x\right )\Big ] + \text {const}, \\ \nonumber & \int \mathrm {e}^{\alpha x}\sin \left (\beta x\right )\, \mathrm {d}x = \frac {1}{\alpha ^{2}+\beta ^{2}}\mathrm {e}^{\alpha x}\Big [\alpha \sin \left (\beta x\right )-\beta \cos \left (\beta x\right )\Big ] + \text {const}. \end{align} $$

^eq-12-19

Using these results we can compute the coefficients to be


$$ \begin{aligned} a_n & = \frac {1}{\pi (1+n^{2})}\left (\mathrm {e}^{2\pi }-1\right ), \\ b_n & = -\frac {n}{\pi (1+n^{2})}\left (\mathrm {e}^{2\pi }-1\right ). \end {aligned}
$$

Figure 12.3 shows the partial sums of the Fourier series, $S_N$ for $N=1,\ldots ,20$.

#### Example 12.11

.  Construct the Fourier cosine series of the even extension of $f(x)=\mathrm {e}^x$ on $[0,\pi ]$.

In this question we first need to construct the even extension of $f(x)$:


$$ f_e(x) = \begin{cases} \mathrm {e}^{x} & x\in [0, \pi ], \\ \mathrm {e}^{-x} & x\in [-\pi , 0], \end {cases} $$
^eq-12-21


which then defines a function on $[-\pi , \pi ]$ which we then extend periodically to the real line. Since in this case $L = \pi$, [[12•3#^eq-12-18]] gives


$$  a_n = \frac {2}{\pi }\int _{0}^{\pi }\mathrm {e}^x\cos \left (nx\right )\,\rd x = \frac {2}{\pi (1+n^2)} \Big ( (-1)^n \mathrm {e}^\pi - 1 \Big ). $$

Figure 12.4 shows the partial sums $S_N$ of the Fourier series for $N=1, \ldots , 20$.

**Remark:** There are some interesting features of figures 12.3 and 12.4 that are worth noting at this point:

1. Noting the different scales on the axes, we see that the cosine series of the even periodic extension converges faster than the full Fourier series of the usual periodic extension.

2. The periodic extension of $\exp (x)$ from $[0,2\pi ]$ to $\mathbb {R}$ is _discontinuous_ at $x=2\pi$, but the even periodic extension of $\exp (x)$ from $(0,\pi )$ to $\mathbb {R}$ is nicer: it is continuous.

3. The coefficients [[12•3#^eq-12-21]] in the Fourier series for $\exp (x)$, decay more slowly than the coefficients [[12•3#^eq-12-23]] in the Fourier cosine series. (More precisely, the $b_n$ coefficients are the slowest ones and decay like $1/n$, whereas the $a_n$ coefficients in [[12•3#^eq-12-23]] decay like $1/n^2$ and the $b_n$ coefficients vanish in the even extension case).

4. It turns out that, as this example illustrates, there is a connection between how fast the Fourier coefficients decay as a function of $n$ and how smooth the function is that they are trying to approximate. The smoother the function, the faster the decay of its Fourier coefficients, and hence the faster the convergence of the Fourier series. In general, the more derivatives $f$ possesses everywhere, the faster the convergence.

5. Typically, if $f$ has discontinuities only in its $p^\mathrm {th}$ derivative, then the coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ decay as $1/n^{p+1}$. So, for example if $f$ has a jump in its values then the decay is like $1/n$ and if $f$ is continuous but its derivative jumps somewhere then the decay is like $1/n^2$.
