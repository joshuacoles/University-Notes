# d’Alembert’s formula Finite Interval

Observe that theorem [[16.6 Existence of d’Alembert forms for Wave Equation Solutions]] did not actually require us to state whether we were considering the infinite line or a finite interval. So it must apply to both cases. 

In fact [[d’Alembert’s formula]],

![[16.7 Explicit Solution from Boundary Conditions#^das-formula]]

for the case of the infinite interval can also be used on a finite interval as long as we consider the appropriate periodic extension of functions from the finite interval to the real line.

## Theorem

Consider the Dirichlet problem for $t > 0, x \in (0,L)$:

$$ \begin{align}
u_{tt} &= c^2 u_{xx}, \\\\

u(0, t) &= 0 \\ 
u(L, t) &= 0, \\\\

u(x, 0) &= u_0(x), \\
u_t(x, 0) &= v_0(x) \equiv 0
\end{align}
$$

Let $\tilde{u}_0$ be the odd $2L$-periodic extension of $u_0(x)$ to the infinite line. The solution of the Dirichlet problem for the wave equation is then given by


$$
u(x,t) = \frac {1}{2} \Big(
	\tilde{u}_0(x-ct) + \tilde{u}_0(x+ct)
\Big).
$$

> **Note** we have specialised to the case where the initial velocity $v_0$ is identically zero.

### Proof

Using the fact that $v_0 = 0$ (and hence $B_n = 0$) and the trigonometric identity, we see that the solution obtained from separation of variables [[16.8  d’Alembert’s formula Finite Interval#^eq-16-16]] becomes

$$
\begin{align}
u(x,t) &= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
	A_n \sin\(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\)\cos\(\frac{n\pi ct}{L}\), \\
&= \frac 12 \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } A_{n} \sin\(
	\frac {n\pi}{L}(x-ct)
\) + \frac 12 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} A_{n} \sin\(
	\frac{n\pi}{L}(x+ct)
\).
\end{align}
$$

^eq-19-17

This solution makes sense both within the finite interval $(0, L)$ and on $\R$.

Looking at the two sets of terms, when either of the coordinates $x - ct$ or $x + ct$ $y\in (0,L)$, then the relevant sum $\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }A_{n} \sin n\pi (x\pm ct)/L$ equals $u_0(x \pm ct)$. But also, when either, or both of the coordinates $x \pm ct$ lies outside $(0,L)$, the same sum equals the odd periodic extension of $u_0$, i.e. $\widetilde {u_0}$, evaluated at the point $x \pm ct$. Therefore, the right-hand side of [[16.8  d’Alembert’s formula Finite Interval#^eq-19-17]] becomes the right-hand side of [[16.8  d’Alembert’s formula Finite Interval#^eq-19-16]] (where we have written the $2L$-periodic odd extension $\widetilde {u_0}$ instead of $u_0$ since $x\pm ct$ might not be in $(0,L)$).
