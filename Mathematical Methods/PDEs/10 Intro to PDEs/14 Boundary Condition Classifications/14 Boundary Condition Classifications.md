# Boundary Condition Classifications

When considering PDEs involved in a problem, we will often see them combined with one or more Boundary Conditions, this is a [[14.21 Boundary Value Problem]]. These come in two main categories.

- [[14.22 Dirichlet Boundary Condition]] where there is a constraint on the value of the function on the boundary.
- [[14.23 Neumann boundary condition]] where there is a constraint on the derivative of the function.

or a linear combination of the two, [[14.24 Robin boundary condition]]. When the boundary condition is in the time variable $t$, it will normally be phrased on a domain $\R^+$ with the boundary at $t = 0$ called the **initial conditions**.
