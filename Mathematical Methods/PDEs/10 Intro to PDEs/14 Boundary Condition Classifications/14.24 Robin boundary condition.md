## Robin boundary condition
	
If a **linear combination** of the function value and its normal derivative is specified along the boundary, this is called a mixed or Robin boundary condition.
    
A mixed boundary condition is
    
    
$$
\alpha (\boldx ) u(\boldx ) + \beta (\boldx ) \pdiff {u(\boldx )}{\boldn } \equiv \alpha (\boldx ) u(\boldx ) + \beta (\boldx ) \boldn \cdot \nabla u = h(\boldx ) \quad \text {for $x\in \p D_i$},
$$

^eq-14-9

where $\alpha (\boldx )$ and $\beta (\boldx )$ are in general functions of $\boldx$ but often are constants.
