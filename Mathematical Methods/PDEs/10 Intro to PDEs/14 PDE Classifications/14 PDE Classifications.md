# PDE Classifications

To study things you have to be able to talk about them properly, which requires the use of precise language to identify features different partial derivatives.

To start with we define a [[14.2 Partial Differential Equation]] as an equation of the form,

![[14.2 Partial Differential Equation#^eq-14-0]]

with a given [[14.2 Partial Differential Equation#Order of PDEs|Order]]. 

We will also classify some PDEs as [[14.4 Linear PDE|14.4 Linear PDEs]], and further a subset of those as [[14.5 Homogeneous PDE|14.5 Homogenous PDEs]] (leading to the [[14.8  Principle of superposition|Principle of superposition]]).
