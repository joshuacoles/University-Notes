## 14.4 Linear PDE

A PDE is _linear_ if it can be written in the form

$$
L(u) = f
$$

^eq-14-2

where $L$ is a linear differential operator and $f(x,y,t)$ is a fixed function (i.e. independent of $u$).

> Recalling that a [[Linear Map|Linear Operator]] is a function $L$ such that $L(a + \lambda b) = L(a) + \lambda L(b)$.
