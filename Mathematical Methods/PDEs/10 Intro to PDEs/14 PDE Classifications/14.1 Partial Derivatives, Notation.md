# Partial Derivatives, Notation

We often will write partial derivatives using subscripts. For example:

$$
\frac {\p u}{\p x} = u_{x}, \quad
\frac {\p ^{2}u}{\p x^{2}} = u_{xx}, \quad
\frac {\p ^{2}u}{\p x\p t} = u_{xt}.
$$

In this unit we will always assume that functions are nice enough for their partial derivatives to exist and commute (i.e. $u_{xt}= u_{tx}$, see [[3.2 Symmetry of the Hessian]]).
