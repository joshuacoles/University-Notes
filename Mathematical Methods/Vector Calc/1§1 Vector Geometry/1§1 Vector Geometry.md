### Parameterisations

From the definition, there are many ways to parameterisation a curve. 

- [[3.7 Parameterisations of a circle]]

One such parameterisation is in terms of arc length $s$ is often easier and more natural to work with.

## 3 Surfaces

Just as for line integrals, we first need to understand how to describe surfaces which, as in the case of line integrals, we almost always do by parameterising them.
