### [[4.7 Exact Differential of a Scalar Function]]

Let $\boldF (x,y,z)=(F_1,F_2,F_3)$ be a vector field in $\R ^3$. If there exists a scalar function $f(x,y,z)$ such that

$$ F_1 = \pdiff {f}{x}, \qquad F_2 = \pdiff {f}{y}, \quad \text {and} \quad F_3 = \pdiff {f}{z} $$

then we say that the differential $\boldF \cdot \rd \boldx = \rd f$ is _exact_.

#### Necessary Conditions

**Remark:** Clearly _necessary_ conditions for exactness are that

$$ \pdiff {F_2}{x} = \pdiff {{}^2f}{x \partial y} = \pdiff {{}^2f}{y \partial x} = \pdiff {F_1}{y}, $$

$$ \pdiff {F_3}{y} = \pdiff {{}^2f}{y \partial z} = \pdiff {{}^2f}{z \partial y} = \pdiff {F_2}{z}, $$

$$ \pdiff {F_1}{z} = \pdiff {{}^2f}{z \partial x} = \pdiff {{}^2f}{x \partial z} = \pdiff {F_3}{x}, $$

> Remember our standing assumption that $f$ is sufficiently nice - here that these second partial derivatives exist and are equal.

#### Validating Exactness

These conditions are clearly useful in providing a check as to whether or not a differential could be exact. And, intriguingly, these conditions turn out to be _sufficient_ as well (assuming a simply-connected domain).
