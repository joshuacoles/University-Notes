### [[4.2 Simply Connected]]

A set $\Omega \subset \R ^3$ is _simply connected_ if (i) a path can be drawn between any two points in $\Omega$ [i.e. $\Omega$ is path-connected], and (ii) any closed curve $C\subset \Omega$ can be shrunk to a point in $\Omega$ through a continuous deformation that remains in $\Omega$ throughout.

**Remark:** This is equivalent to the definition given in the text previously, immediately after [[2.19 Conservative Fields]].
