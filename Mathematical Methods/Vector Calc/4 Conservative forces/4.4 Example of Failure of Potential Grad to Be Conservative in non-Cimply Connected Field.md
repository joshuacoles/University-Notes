### [[4.4 Example of Failure of Potential Grad to Be Conservative in non-Cimply Connected Field]]

Consider the vector field

$$ \boldF = \left ( -\frac {y}{x^2+y^2}, \frac {x}{x^2+y^2},0 \right )^T $$

which can be written in the form $\boldF =\nabla \phi$ where $\phi (\boldx )=\tan ^{-1}(y/x)$ (check!). If we consider the closed path $C$ given by $\boldx (t)=(a\cos t,a\sin t,0)$ for $t \in [0,2\pi ]$ then

$$
\begin{align*}
\oint_C \boldF \dp \rd \boldx
&= \int_0^{2\pi } \boldF \dp \diff{\boldx}{t} \,\rd t 

\\
&= \int_0^{2\pi } \begin{pmatrix}
	-\frac {1}{a}\sin t \\
	\frac {1}{a}\cos t \\
	0
\end{pmatrix} \dp \begin{pmatrix}
	-a\sin t \\
	a \cos t \\
	0
\end {pmatrix} \,\rd t

\\
&= 2\pi
\end{align*}
$$

in contradiction with (4.3) and therefore apparently contradicting [[4.3 Properties of Conservative Fields]] since it looks as though $\boldF$ is a conservative vector field.

The contradiction is resolved by observing that $\boldF$ is defined only on $\R ^3\backslash \{(0,0,z)\}$ which is **not a simply-connected domain**.
