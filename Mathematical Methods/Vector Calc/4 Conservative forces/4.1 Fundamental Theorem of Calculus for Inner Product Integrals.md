### [[4.1 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Inner Product Integrals]]

Let $\phi$ be a (sufficiently smooth) scalar field, and let $C$ be a (sufficiently nice) curve with parametrisation $\boldx (t)$ for $a\leq t\leq b$. Then

$$  \int _C \nabla \phi \cdot \rd \boldx = \phi (\boldx (b)) - \phi (\boldx (a)) \ . $$

So, interestingly, the value of the integral depends only on the endpoints, not on the details of the chosen path $C$.

#### Proof

$$ \int _C \nabla \phi \cdot \rd \boldx = \int _a^b \nabla \phi (\boldx (t))\cdot \boldx ’(t)\, \rd t. $$

But by the chain rule and the definition of the gradient,



$$ \begin{align*} \diff {}{t}\phi \big (\boldx (t)\big ) &= \pdiff {\phi }{x} \diff {x}{t} + \pdiff {\phi }{y} \diff {y}{t} + \pdiff {\phi }{z} \diff {z}{t} \\ &= \nabla \phi \big (\boldx (t)\big )\cdot \boldx ’(t). \end{align*} $$ (where the orthonormal basis vectors $\bolde _x$ etc are implicit but have been omitted).

Therefore,



$$ \int _C \nabla \phi \cdot \rd \boldx = \int _a^b\diff {}{t}\phi \big (\boldx (t)\big )\,\rd t, $$

and the result follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in 1D. □

#### Failure of the Converse under Similar Conditions

It turns out that _in general_

$$ \exists \ \phi \text { such that }\boldF = \nabla \phi \not \Rightarrow \int _C \boldF \cdot \, \rd \boldx \text { is independent of the choice of the path} C $$

An example of which is provided in [[4.4 Example of Failure of Potential Grad to Be Conservative in non-Cimply Connected Field]].

For the implication to hold we need to specify carefully the precise region where the force and potential functions are considered. This requires [[4.2 Simply Connected]].
