# [[7.9 Divergence Form of Green’s Theorem in the Plane]] (aka Divergence Theorem Form)

Let $D \subset \R^2$ be a [[7.2 Bounded Domains|Bounded]] [[7.1 Domains|Domain]] with a [[Definition 2.22|Boundry]] Curve $C = \partial D$ that is [[3.2 Simple Curves|Simple]], sufficiently smooth, and [[7.8 Orientation of a Boundary Curve|Orientated]] in the *anticlockwise/positive* sense.

Let $p(x,y)$ and $q(x,y)$ be continuously differentiable functions in $D$. Then

$$
\iint_D \( \pdiff {p}{x} + \pdiff {q}{y} \) \, \rd A =
\oint_C \begin{pmatrix} p \\ q \end {pmatrix} \dp \boldwiden \, \rd s,
$$

where $\boldwiden$ is the outward pointing unit normal to $C$ in the $(x,y)$ plane.

> ### Remark
> This is a corollary of the divergence theorem applied to a plane and feels very like the divergence theorem but in one dimension lower. Indeed, on the left hand side we have a ‘two-dimensional divergence’ and on the right hand side we have something that looks like a ‘flux across a curve’ (rather than across a surface).

## Proof

To prove this we use the [[7.6 The Divergence Theorem]], defining a 3D volume which reduces cleanly to the required planar area $D$. Given that $D \sub \R^2$ is [[7.2 Bounded Domains|bounded]], and $p(x, y), q(x,y)$ are continuously differentiable as necessary, we define the following,

A vector field, 

$$
\boldF = \begin{pmatrix}p(x,y) \\ q(x,y) \\ 0\end{pmatrix}
$$

and the volume $\Omega$, as the area $D$ extended upwards from $z = 0 \to z = 1$ ,

$$ \Omega = \set{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb {R}^3 : (x,y) \in D, \, z \in [0, 1]} \equiv D \times [0,1]. $$

In the following, we write $\boldn$ for the 3D normal associated with the divergence theorem (to be distinguished from $\boldwiden$ the 2D planar normal in the statement of Green's Theorem above). We now apply the divergence theorem to $\Omega$. 

Starting with the LHS we have,

$$ 
\begin{align*}
\iiint_\Omega \divrg \boldF \, \rd {V}
&= \int_0^1 \iint_D \( \pdiff {p}{x} + \pdiff {q}{y}\) \,\rd x \,\rd y \,\rd z
\end{align*}
$$

which simplfies to

$$
\begin{align*}
\iiint_\Omega \divrg \boldF \, \rd {V}
&= \iint_D \(\pdiff {p}{x} + \pdiff {q}{y}\) \,\rd {x} \,\rd {y} \(\int_0^1 \, \rd {z}\) \\
&= \iint_D \(\pdiff {p}{x} + \pdiff {q}{y}\) \,\rd {x} \,\rd {y}
\end{align*}
$$

since the integrand does not depend on $z$. So from the divergence theorem we have that

$$ \iint _D \left (\pdiff {p}{x} + \pdiff {q}{y}\right ) \, \rd {x} \rd {y} = \iint _{\partial \Omega } \boldF \cdot \boldn \, \rd S. $$

Now attacking the RHS. The surface $\partial \Omega$ is composed of three pieces:

- The top ($z = 1$) 
- The bottom ($z = 0$)
- The 'cylinder' formed by the curve $C$ (the boundary of $D$) as $z$ varies from zero to one.

The top and the bottom cancel as $\boldF \dp \boldn = 0$ since the normal $\boldn$ points in the $z$ direction (upwards for the top, downwards for the bottom). This leaves the cylinder defined as so,

$$
B : \set{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb {R}^3 \ : \ (x,y) \in C, \, z \in [0, 1]} \equiv C \times [0,1].
$$

On the cylinder, the outwards-pointing normal $\boldn$ has $x$ and $y$ components equal to those of $\boldwiden$ the normal to the curve $C$, with the addition of a zero $\bolde _z$ component: $\boldn = (\widehat {n}_1,\widehat {n}_2,0)^T$. Moreover on the cylinder

$$ \rd {S} = \rd s_C \,\rd z, $$

because areas are small rectangles of height $\rd z$ and width given by the 2D arclength $\rd s$ along the curve $C$, as in the $(x,y)$ plane. Hence the surface integral from applying the divergence theorem to $\Omega$ can be written as

$$
\begin{align*}
\iint_{\partial \Omega} \boldF \dp \boldn \,\rd S
&= \int_{z=0}^1
	\int_C \begin {pmatrix}
		p \\ q \\ 0
	\end {pmatrix} \dp \boldn \,\rd s
\,\rd z \\
&= \int_0^1 \left \{ \oint_C \begin {pmatrix} p \\ q \end{pmatrix} \dp \boldwiden \,\rd s \right \} \,\rd z \\
&= \oint _C \begin {pmatrix}p \\ q\end {pmatrix} \dp \boldwiden \,\rd s.
\end{align*}
$$

where the last equality follows from the $z$-independence of the inner integral.
