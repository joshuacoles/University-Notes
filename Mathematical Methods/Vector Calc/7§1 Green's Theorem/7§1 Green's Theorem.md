# Green’s Theorem

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green's_theorem)

Green's Theorem is an application of the [[7.6 The Divergence Theorem]] to areas in the $\R^2$ plane, relating an Area Integral of a region to the Line Integral of its boundary.

This theorem is sensitive to the directionality of the boundary, thus first we need to establish the [[7.8 Orientation of a Boundary Curve]], here we will work with *positively-oriented*, **[[3.2 Simple Curves|Simple]] [[3.3 Closed Cuves|Closed]] [[3.1 Definition of a Curve|Curves]]** (ie ones that have equal start and end points but otherwise are not self-intersecting).

We express this theorem in two equivalent forms,

- [[7.9 Divergence Form of Green’s Theorem in the Plane]]
- [[7.10 Stokes' Form of Green's Theorem in the Plane]]
	- [[7.11 Separated Differentials Form of Green’s Theorem]]

Presenting one useful application.

- [[7.12 Calculating an Area via a Line Integral]]
- [[7.13  Use of Green's Theorem to Calculate Enclosed Area]]
