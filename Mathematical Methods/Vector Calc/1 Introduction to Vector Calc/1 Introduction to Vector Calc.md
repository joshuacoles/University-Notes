## A Comment on Dimensions

We will mostly work in 3D. Where we state a 2D result, it might be helpful to think of this as a result holding in (a subset of) the plane $z=0$.

In general most of the concepts in the course can be extended abstractly to higher dimensions but we will leave this for later units.
