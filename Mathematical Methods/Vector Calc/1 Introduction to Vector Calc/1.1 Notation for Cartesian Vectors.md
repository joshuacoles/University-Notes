## [[1.1 Notation for Cartesian Vectors]]

Notation for this material is slightly problematic as there are often equivalent notations for the same object and different books, lecturers, and tutors may use different standard notations. For example a vector in usual Cartesian components in $\R ^3$ can be written as

$$
\begin{align*}
\bolda &=
\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end {pmatrix}
\\ &= a_1 \boldi + a_2 \boldj + a_3 \boldk 
\\ &= a_1 \bolde_1 + a_2 \bolde_2 + a_3 \bolde_3 
\\ &= a_1 \bolde_x + a_2 \bolde_y + a_3 \bolde_z
\end{align*}
$$

**These are equivalent.** *Indeed, one could say that stacking elements $a_1,a_2,a_3$ into a column vector is only given a meaning if we know what basis vectors to assign to each entry.* The $\boldi \boldj \boldk$ notation is preferred but all may be used. This notational equivalence is expressed below,

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\bolde_x &\equiv \bolde_1 &\equiv \boldi &\equiv \uvi
\\
\bolde_y &\equiv \bolde_2 &\equiv \boldj &\equiv \uvj 
\\
\bolde_z &\equiv \bolde_3 &\equiv \boldk &\equiv \uvk
\end{eqnarray}
$$
