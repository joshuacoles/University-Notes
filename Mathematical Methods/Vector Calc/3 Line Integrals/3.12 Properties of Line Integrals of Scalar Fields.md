### [[3.12 Properties of Line Integrals of Scalar Fields]]

#### Linearity

If $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are constants and $f$ and $g$ are scalar fields, then

$$ \int _C (\lambda f + \mu g) \, \rd s = \lambda \int _C f \, \rd s + \mu \int _C g \, \rd s. $$

#### Additivity w.r.t. curves
If $C= C_1 \cup C_2$ then

$$ \int _C f \, \rd s = \int _{C_1} f\, \rd s + \int *{C_2} f\, \rd s. $$

##### Independence of direction
Given change of direction as defined by [[3.9 Reversal of a Curve]],

$$\int _{-C} f\, \rd s = \int _{C} f\, \rd s.
  $$

**Remark:** The first two properties follow directly from the definition (3.3); you will prove the 3rd property on Problem Sheet 1. Note that property 2 allows us to extend the definitions of line integrals to integrals over curves which have finitely many continuously differentiable pieces separated by corners, i.e. ‘piecewise-smooth’ curves such as the boundary of a planar polygon.

**Remark:** The length $L$ of a curve $C$ given by $\boldx : [a,b] \rightarrow \R ^3$ can therefore be computed by setting $f$ to be one, i.e. computing

$$ L(C) := \int _C \ \rd s $$

which shows that, while the length of a curve is independent of its parametrisation, different curves $C$ that nevertheless have the same start and end points $\boldx (a)$, $\boldx (b)$ will in general have different lengths and so the value of these line integrals will in general depend on the choice of path, not just on the choice of end points.
