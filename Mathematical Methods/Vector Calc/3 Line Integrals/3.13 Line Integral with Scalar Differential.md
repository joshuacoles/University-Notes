### [[3.13 Line Integral with Scalar Differential]]

Let $C$ be a (piecewise-smooth) curve and $\boldF$ be a (continuous) vector field. Then

$$
\int_C \boldF \, \rd s = \begin{pmatrix}
\int_C F_1 \, \rd s \\
\int_C F_2 \, \rd s \\
\int_C F_3 \, \rd s
\end {pmatrix}
$$

which in index notation is expressed concisely as,

$$
\left(\int_C \boldF \, \rd s\right)_i = \int_C F_i \, \rd s.
$$

(compare to [[2.8 Double integrals of vector fields]])

All the properties in [[3.12 Properties of Line Integrals of Scalar Fields]] for line integrals of scalar fields hold for this first type of line integral of vector fields because of this â€œcomponent-wise" definition - we are in effect just computing three separate line integrals of the previous kind treating each component separately.
