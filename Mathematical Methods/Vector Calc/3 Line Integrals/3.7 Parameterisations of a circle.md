### [[3.7 Parameterisations of a circle]]

One parameterisation of a circle of radius $a$ in the plane $z=0$ is to write

$$ \boldx (t) = a(\cos t, \sin t,0), $$

for $t\in [0, 2\pi ]$. But $t$ does not describe arclength since a circle of radius $a$ clearly has diameter $2\pi a$ but $t$ is measured only in the interval $[0,2\pi ]$. Compute the rate of change of arclength with $t$:

$$
\begin{eqnarray} \diff {\boldx }{t} & = & a(-\sin t, \cos t,0) \nonumber \\ \implies \left | \diff {\boldx }{t} \right |^2 & = & a^2 \nonumber \\ \implies s(t) & = & \int \_0^t a \, \rd tâ€™ = a t \nonumber \end{eqnarray}
$$

so the relation between arclength and the parameter $t$ is $s=at$. Hence in terms of arclength we describe the circle by writing

$$
\boldx(s) = a \left ( \cos (s/a), \sin (s/a), 0 \right )
$$
