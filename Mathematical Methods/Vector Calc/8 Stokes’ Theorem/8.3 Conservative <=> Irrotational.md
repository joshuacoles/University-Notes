# [[8.3 Conservative <=> Irrotational]]

Let $\Omega \subset \R ^3$ be a [[4.2 Simply Connected]] [[7.1 Domains|Domain]]. $\boldF$ is [[2.19 Conservative Fields|Conservative]] on $\Omega$ if and only if $\boldF$ is [[6.8 Curl-Free Fields|irrotational]] on $\Omega$.

## Proof

### Conservative => Irrotational

**Proof:** ($\Rightarrow$) Since $\boldF$ is conservative, we have that $\exists \phi$ such that $F=\nabla \phi$. Then

$$ \nabla \times \boldF = \nabla \times (\nabla \phi ) = 0 $$

by the vector identity that curl grad equals zero ([[6.10 Properties of Certain Second Derivatives]]).

### Irrotational => Conservative

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose that $\boldF$ is irrotational, i.e. that $\nabla \times \boldF =\boldzero$. We need to show that $\oint _C \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx =0$ for any closed curve $C\subset \Omega$, in which case [[4.3 Properties of Conservative Fields]] will then imply that $\boldF$ is conservative. Let $C$ be any curve in $\Omega$, and let $S$ be a correspondingly oriented surface in $\Omega$ whose boundary curve is $C$. Note that since the domain is simply connected, we can always find such a surface $S$. Then, since by assumption $\nabla \times \boldF = \boldzero$ for all $\boldx \in \Omega$, it follows from Stokesâ€™ theorem that



$$ \oint _C \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx = \iint _S (\nabla \times \boldF )\cdot \boldn \, \rd S = 0. $$

This completes both directions of the proof.
