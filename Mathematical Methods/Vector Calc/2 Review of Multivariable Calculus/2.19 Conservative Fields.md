### [[2.19 Conservative Fields]]

The vector field $\boldF$ is called _conservative_ if there exists a scalar field, $\phi$, defined on a simply connected region $\Omega \subset \R ^3$, such that $\boldF = \nabla \phi$ in $\Omega$.

A region $\Omega \subset \R ^3$ is _simply connected_ if any pair of closed loops in $\Omega$ can be deformed smoothly into each other. Note that if $\phi$ is a scalar potential for $\boldF$, then $\phi + c$ is also a scalar potential for $\boldF$ for every constant $c\in \R$. Therefore a potential is not unique.
