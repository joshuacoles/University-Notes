### [[2.17 Gradient as direction of steepest descent]]

If $\nabla f(\boldx _0)\neq \boldzero$, then the vector $\bolda = \nabla f$ points in the direction of steepest descent (or ascent!). This can be written as

$$
\max _{\bolda \in \R ^3 \setminus \{\boldzero \}} \big | D_{\bolda } f (\boldx_0)\big | = | \nabla f (\boldx_0)|.
$$

If $\nabla f(\boldx _0)=\boldzero$ (the zero vector) then the maximum is zero and is attained in every direction.

#### Proof

From [[2.16 Link between directional derivative and gradient#^930e4e]] we see that the modulus of the left-hand side is maximised when $\theta$ is an integer multiple of $\pi$, i.e. when $\widehat {\bolda }$ and $\nabla f$ point in the same direction or $180^\circ$ from one another. Clearly, one of these is a steepest ‘ascent’ ($f$ increasing) and the other is the steepest ‘descent’ ($f$ decreasing).
