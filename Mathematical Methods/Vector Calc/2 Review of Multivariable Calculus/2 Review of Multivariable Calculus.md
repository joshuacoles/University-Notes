# Chapter 2 A review of Multivariable calculus

In this chapter we review some of the basic ideas of integration in multiple dimensions, notably,

- The concept of changing variables from integration in Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$ to another (curvilinear) coordinate system.
- We will then review the notion of the gradient operator, and the related ideas of conservative fields and potentials.

Unless the text states something different, we will assume that all functions are **continuously differentiable as many times as required for the relevant expression to make sense** (this is known as ***sufficiently nice***).
