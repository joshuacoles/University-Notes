### [[5.13 Example of Surface Integral, Surface area of a Sphere]]

On the problem sheet, you are asked to use (5.12) to show that when $S$ is the sphere of radius $a$, $\{ \boldx : x^2 + y^2 +z^2 =a^2\}$,

$$  \rd S = a^2 \sin \varphi \, \rd \theta \, \rd \varphi , $$

where we are using the parametric representation (5.4) (i.e. spherical polar coordinates). Therefore, the surface area of this sphere is given by integrating $1$ over the surface:

$$ \iint _S \rd S = a^2 \int _0^{\pi } \int _0^{2\pi } \sin \varphi \,\rd \theta \, \rd \varphi = 2 \pi a^2 \int _0^{\pi } \sin \varphi \, \rd \varphi = 4 \pi a^2. $$
