### [[5.17 Physical Interpretation of Flux Integral]]

Suppose that a particular fluid flow is defined by $\boldu$ (i.e. the fluid’s velocity at $\boldx \in \R ^3$ is given by the vector $\boldu (\boldx )$). Then $\int _S \boldu \cdot \rd \boldS$ is the volume of fluid that passes through $S$ (in the “outward" direction) per unit time.

**Proof:** Consider a small patch of surface $\delta \boldS = \boldn \delta S$. Note that $\boldu \cdot \boldn$ is the component of the velocity in the normal direction. Over a time $\delta t$ a ‘column’ of fluid of length $\boldu \cdot \boldn \,\delta t$ crosses the surface.

Since volume $=$ length $\times$ area, the volume occupied by the fluid that exits during a time $\delta t$ is $\boldu \cdot \boldn \, \delta t\, \delta S$. Dividing by $\delta t$ (to obtain a quantity per unit time), and summing over all patches $\delta S$, we get the result. □
