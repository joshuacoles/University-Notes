### [[5.12 Scalar Surface Integrals via a Parametric Representation]]

Let $S$ be a (sufficiently smooth) surface with [[5.4 Parametric Representation]]. Then

$$
\iint_S f(\boldx ) \,\rd S(\boldx)
=
\iint_D f(\boldx (u,v))
\left |\pdiff{\boldx}{u}\times \pdiff {\boldx}{v}\right|
\rd u\,\rd v,
$$

Where we have written

$$  \rd S =\left |\pdiff {\boldx }{u}\times \pdiff {\boldx }{v}\right | \rd u\,\rd v; $$

which we call the “Surface Element".

#### Proof

The main step in proving the theorem is to develop the correct expression for the area of an infinitesimal surface element $\rd {S}$.

Let $\delta S$ be a small area of surface whose boundary is given by the parallelogram with corners $\boldx (u_0,v_0)$, $\boldx (u_0+\delta u, v_0)$, $\boldx (u_0, v_0+\delta v)$, and $\boldx (u_0+\delta u, v_0+\delta v)$. By Taylor’s theorem, for $\delta u$ small,

$$ \boldx (u_0+ \delta u, v_0) = \boldx (u_0,v_0) +\pdiff {\boldx }{u}(u_0,v_0) \,\delta u + O(\delta u)^2, $$

and similarly for $\boldx (u_0, v_0+ \delta v)$. The sides of the parallelogram forming the boundary of $\delta S$ are the two vectors $\boldx (u_0+ \delta u, v_0) - \boldx (u_0, v_0)$ and $\boldx (u_0, v_0 + \delta v) - \boldx (u_0, v_0)$, and hence the area of $\delta S$ is given by the magnitude of the cross product. Thus



$$ \delta S \approx \left | \pdiff {\boldx }{u}(u_0,v_0) \times \pdiff {\boldx }{v}(u_0,v_0)\right | \delta u\, \delta v. $$

Using this in (5.10) and taking the limits of $\delta u, \, \delta v \to 0$ we deduce (5.11). □

**Remark:** For fixed $v=v_0$, the points $\boldx (u,v_0)$, as $u$ varies, trace out a curve that lies inside the surface $S$. So the 1D theory applies, and $\pdiff {\boldx }{u}(u_0,v_0)$ is a tangent vector to that curve at the point $\boldx (u_0,v_0)$.

**Remark:** Connection with the Jacobian [[5.12 Scalar Surface Integrals via a Parametric Representation]], which demonstrates how to convert a surface element,

$$ \rd {S} = |\boldx _u \times \boldx _v| \, \rd {u} \, \rd {v}, $$

is in fact the same result (and proof) that we used in order to convert between coordinate systems via the Jacobian. Consider a mapping of a region $R_{uv}$ in the $(u, v)$ plane to a region $R$ in the $(x,y)$ plane, i.e. the subspace $z=0$ in $\R ^3$. Let $\boldx = (x(u,v), \, y(u,v), 0)$ and then verify that



$$ \left |\pdiff {\boldx }{u} \times \pdiff {\boldx }{v}\right | = \left |\left ( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ \pdiff {x}{u} \pdiff {y}{v} - \pdiff {x}{v} \pdiff {y}{u} \end {array} \right )\right | = \frac {\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)}. $$

In other words, in 2D, the cross-product term is nothing more than the Jacobian factor which allows for conversion between coordinate systems. For example, using the polar coordinate mapping:

$$ \boldx (r, \theta ) = (r\cos \theta , r\sin \theta , 0), $$

we find that

$$ \rd {S} = r \, \rd {r} \, \rd {\theta }, $$

which recovers the familiar Jacobian for plane polar coordinates.
