# [[5.1 Representations of Surfaces]]

There are three ways of representing surfaces in $\R^3$,

- [[5.2 Explicit Representation]]
- [[5.3 Implicit Representation]]
- [[5.4 Parametric Representation]]

Different applications naturally lend themselves to different ways to describe or represent surfaces, each allowing different information to computed easily.

## Explicit => Parametric

Given an Explicit Representation $z = f(x, y)$, we can form a Parametric Representation,

$$C: (a, b, f(a, b)$$

## Explicit => Implicit

Given the explicit representation $z=f(x,y)$, an implicit representation is always available: $F(x,y,z):=z-f(x,y)$.

## Parametric => Implicit

Conversion between parametric and implicit forms is not automatic or straightforward. This is true even for curves (i.e. ‘1D surfaces’).

For **curves**, the process of deducing an equivalent implicit equation from a parametric form is called “implicitisation” and is, however, always possible.

## Implicit => Parametric

Moving from an implicit equation to a parametric form is called “parameterisation” and is in general possible only for implicit curves of degree 1 or 2 (i.e. conic sections).

As a motivating example consider something like the curve defined implicitly by,

$$y^2 - 8x^2 - 8x^3 + 1 = 0.$$

Since this has two disconnected pieces, it cannot be the image of a parameterisation $\boldx (t)$ for $t \in [a,b]$ since the image of the interval $[a,b]$ must be connected and the map $\boldx$ is continuous.
