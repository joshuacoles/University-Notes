### [[5.11 Definition of a Surface Integral as a Riemann Sum]]

Given a (sufficiently smooth) surface $S\subset \R ^3$, subdivide $S$ into $N$ pieces $S_1,\ldots , S_N$ with surface areas $\delta S_1,\ldots ,\delta S_N$. In each of the piece choose an arbitrary point $\boldx _i$. Then, for any scalar function $f$ on $S$,

$$  \iint _S f \, \rd S = \iint _S f(\boldx ) \, \rd S(\boldx ) :=\lim _{N\rightarrow \infty } \sum _{i=1}^N f(\boldx _i) \, \delta S_i, $$

provided that this limit exists and is independent both of the choice of $\boldx _i$ and of the particular subdivision.

In practice we compute surface integrals using a parameterisation (i.e. a parametric representation).
