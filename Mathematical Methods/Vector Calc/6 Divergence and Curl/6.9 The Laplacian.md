### [[6.9 The Laplacian]]

For a scalar field $f$, we define the _Laplace operator_, or _Laplacian_ of $f$ to be

$$ \nabla ^2 f := \nabla \cdot (\nabla f) = \pdiff {^2 f}{x^2}+\pdiff {^2 f}{y^2}+\pdiff {^2 f}{z^2}. $$

We call $\nabla ^2$ the _Laplace operator_ or _Laplacian_. The Laplacian is such an important operator that it is sometimes given its own symbol: $\Delta$. The definition of the Laplacian can be extended to vector fields $\boldF$ just by applying $\nabla ^2$ to each component of $\boldF$ in turn:

$$ \nabla ^2 \boldF := \left ( \begin{array}{c} \nabla ^2 F_1\\ \nabla ^2 F_2\\ \nabla ^2 F_3\\ \end {array} \right ) $$

**Remark:** The equation $\nabla ^2 f = 0$ is known as **Laplaceâ€™s equation** and is one of the key partial differential equations that we will meet in the second part of this course.
