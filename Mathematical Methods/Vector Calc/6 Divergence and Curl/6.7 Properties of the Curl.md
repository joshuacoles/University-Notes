### [[6.7 Properties of the Curl]]

(Basic properties of the curl). If $\boldF$ and $\boldG$ are differentiable vector fields, $\phi (\boldx )$ is a differentiable scalar field, and $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are constants, then

$$  \nabla \times (\lambda \boldF + \mu \boldG ) = \lambda \nabla \times \boldF + \mu \nabla \times \boldG , $$

and

$$  \nabla \times (\phi \boldF ) =(\nabla \phi )\times \boldF + \phi (\nabla \times \boldF ). $$

Idea for the proof of [[6.7 Properties of the Curl]]. For (6.7), use the definition of the curl (6.5) and the linearity of differentiation. For (6.8), use the definition of the curl (6.5) and the product rule.
