### [[6.1 Divergence]]

Let $\Omega \subset \R ^3$ and let $\boldF :\Omega \to \R ^3$ be a differentiable vector field. The _divergence_ of $\boldF =(F_1,F_2,F_3)$ on $\Omega$ is a scalar function defined by

$$
\divrg \boldF
= \parfrac{F_1}{x}
+ \parfrac{F_2}{y}
+ \parfrac{F_3}{z}.
$$

Or occasionally written $\mathrm{div}\,\boldF$. In index notation, this is simply written as

$$
\divrg \boldF = \pdiff {F_i}{x_i}.
$$

This notation making it abundantly clear that $\divrg \boldF$ is a *scalar field* (no free indices).

#### Differential Operator

If we think of $\nabla$ as,

$$
\nab = \begin{pmatrix}
\dparfrac{}x & \dparfrac{}x & \dparfrac{}z
\end{pmatrix},
$$

then $\nabla \cdot \boldF$ is, as it is written, the inner product $\bolda \cdot \boldb$ where $\bolda = \nabla$ and $\boldb =\boldF$.

However, this is potentially dangerous as it breaks some rules of vector spaces. For example, although the scalar product is commutative: $\boldb \cdot \bolda =\bolda \cdot \boldb$, this is not the case here:

$$
\boldF \cdot \nab = F_1 \pdiff{}x + F_2 \pdiff {}y +  F_3 \pdiff{}z \neq \nabla \cdot \boldF
$$

this shows that $\boldF \cdot \nabla$ is actually a differential operator, whereas $\nabla \cdot \boldF$ is a scalar function.

If you want to consider this further, look into *'actions'* from Algebra 1A.
