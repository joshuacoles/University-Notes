# [[6.11 Gradient of Function is Curl Free]]

- [[2.13 Gradient]]
- [[6.5 Curl]]
- [[6.8 Curl-Free Fields|Curl-Free]]

$$\curl (\nabla f) = \boldzero.$$

## Proof

We apply the definitions of gradient and curl directly:

$$ \nabla \times (\nabla f) = \left | \begin{array}{ccc} \bolde _x & \bolde _y & \bolde _z \\ \pdiff {}{x} & \pdiff {}{y} & \pdiff {}{z} \\ \pdiff {f}{x} & \pdiff {f}{y} & \pdiff {f}{z} \end {array} \right | = \left (\pdiff {{}^2 f}{z\partial y} - \pdiff {{}^2f}{y\partial z}\right )\bolde _x - \left (\pdiff {{}^2 f}{z\partial x} - \pdiff {{}^2f}{x\partial z}\right )\bolde _y + \left (\pdiff {{}^2 f}{y\partial x} - \pdiff {{}^2f}{x\partial y}\right )\bolde _z $$

which is identically zero by our assumption on differentiability of $f$ and the resulting symmetry of its second order partial derivatives.
