In standard analysis you will see integrals with respect to variables such as $x, y, z$, etc. With bounds defined explicitly, for example

$$
\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 x^2\,\d x && \int_0^1\int_0^y xy\,\d x\,\d y.
\end{align*}
$$

These are fine in the general sense but you go up the abstraction ladder, the exact things you integrate with respect to are either "fuzzy" or unimportant. For example a surface integral might be expressed as,

$$
\iint_S \curl F \,\d A
$$

Here we see two important changes from the original examples. Firstly
