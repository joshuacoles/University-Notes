Thus far we have considered [[Maxwell's Equations]] within the [[Vacuum]] obtaining a set of equations with universal applicability (at least within the classical realm). These are also known as the microscopic variant.

When dealing with these equations in materials however they become unwieldy as they relate the electric and magnetic fields to total charge and total current, including the complicated charges and currents in materials at the atomic scale. Factors for this complication include,

- Waves propagating across media.
- Induced oscillations of atomic cores and electrons.
- Temporary dipoles / current flows in materials in response to the presence of Electric and Magnetic fields.    
- EM waves hitting boundaries between materials and we need to be able to describe their reflection/transmission
    
Instead we form a Macroscopic variant of these equations defining two new auxiliary fields, that describe the large-scale behaviour of matter **without** having to consider atomic scale charges and quantum phenomena like spins.

This births a less "pure" theory but one of much more experimental use.
