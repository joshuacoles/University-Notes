## [[Coloumb's Law]]

The force between 2 stationary charges $Q_1$ and $Q_2$,

$$
\vec{F}_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2} \uvec{r}
$$

- Note [[Permittivity of Free Space]] has units $\mathrm{F. m^{-1}}$.

Define [[Electric Field]], Force Experienced by unit charge, near other charge $Q$ with

$$
\E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} Q
$$

Having units $\mathrm{V. m^{-1}} = \mathrm{N. C^{-1}}$

Thus allowing us to write,

$$
\vec{F}_e = Q_2 \E
$$

## [[Principle of Superposition]]
- Linearity
- Field due to many charges is equal to the sum of the field of each.
	- Note the distributive nature of that statement.
- Equivalent to no 2nd order interaction effects.

----

Applying this use we can [[Charge Distributions]], to deal with non-point cases. Eg.

- Let $V'$ be the volume extent of a charged object.
- Let $\rho(\vec{r'})$ be the charge density of that object.

We let,

$$
\E(\r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}
\intl_{\vec{r'} \in V'} \rho(\vec{r'}) \,\d V
$$

This the [[Integral Form]] of [[Coloumb's Law]].
