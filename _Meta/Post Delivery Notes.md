# Post Delivery Notes

Lets say you want to study a **course** that you are not formally taught.

1. Download **everything**
	- You are never sure how long you will have access to things so download with prejudice!
	- `wget --recursive --no-parent` is your friend
	- In addition you can also use the [Panopto Exporter](https://github.com/joshuacoles/Panopto-Exporter).
2. Assess notes
	- Are they formatted in a way amenable to automatic conversion.
		- `Lwarp`: yes
		- `TexHt`: no
		- PDF, consider Margin Note to get lay of land.
	- Are they brief notes or are they comprehensive.	
		- Often times some lecturers will give you notes, but these can only be understood in the context of lectures.
3. See [[Extraction Thesis]].
