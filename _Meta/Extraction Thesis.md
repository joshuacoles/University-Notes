# Thesis

Up until now extraction has resolved around literally performing an `html => md` conversion. This has its advantages but also its drawbacks.

To improve this system we need to develop two complementary technologies.

1. We need to be able to extract structure more effectively from the source materials.
2. We need to be able to manipulating notes in their markdown form.

## Extraction

This includes,

- Better extracting TOC information.
- Styling of notes to allow for easier human extraction.
- Detection of note internal TOC even when not present.

## Structure

- When creating empty notes and lazy, just screenshot in the material or link to it with a tag of #programming-note/develop.
- At a minimum, every noun should have a primary **linkable note**.
