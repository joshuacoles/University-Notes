 # Dogma

## Physics
- Physics tells a narrative so we start with that narrative in the form of the `Lectures` folder
	- One note per lecture, with a link to its panopto and maybe succeeding and preceding?
- We can write on the computer as there is generally much less maths in physics, which is the slow thing to type, and that which there is is often repetitive and open to copy/paste.
- One assumes we will be eventually taking the things out of the Lecture form into their separate note?
	- Linking back to the lecture itself probably isn't a bad thing.

```ad-question
Can we move the header into the metadata and generate custom HTML from that?
```

## Maths

- See how the combination of [[Margin Node]] and the [[Lecture Series]] narrative structure goes for [[Analysis 2B]]
  - Ie, can we use the Margin Note system to act as an easy backing to fill out content as it is discussed in Lectures.

- XXX Keyed objects are things I want to add that dont appear on the spec.
- III keyed objects are general ideas.
- Number keying notes is freeing, do it
- Its okay to have notes for the same concept at different conceptual levels (eg. continuity, differentiability, etc), have them all link to a "common note" maybe?
