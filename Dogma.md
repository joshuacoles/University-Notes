# Dogma
## Physics
- Physics tells a narrative so we start with that narrative in the form of the `Lectures` folder
	- One note per lecture, with a link to its panopto and maybe succeeding and preceding?
- We can write on the computer as there is generally much less maths in physics, which is the slow thing to type, and that which there is is often repetitive and open to copy/paste.
- One assumes we will be eventually taking the things out of the Lecture form into their separate note?
	- Linking back to the lecture itself probably isn't a bad thing.

> **Question**: Can we move the header into the metadata and generate custom HTML from that?
