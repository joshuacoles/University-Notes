### [[Theorem 3.12]]

(Weierstrass) Every infinite and bounded set $A\subset R^n$ has a cluster point.

Proof. $A$ being bounded, there exists $R>0$ such that $A\subset [-R,R]^n$, where $[-R,R]^n$ denoted the $n$-dimensional cube, which is compact by [[Theorem 3.8]]. By [[Lemma 3.11]], the compact set $[-R,R]^n$ contains an infinite set, which has then a cluster point in $[-R,R]^n$, hence in $\R ^n$.
