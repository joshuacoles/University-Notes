### [[Corollary 3.14]]

Let $(K_i)_{i\in \N }$ be a sequence of nonempty compact sets in $\R ^n$ such that $K_i\supseteq K_{i+1}$ for every $i\in \N$. Then the intersection

$$ \bigcap _{i=1}^\infty K_i $$

is nonempty.

The compactness of the sets is crucial for this result to hold, as these non-compact **counter**-examples will show:
