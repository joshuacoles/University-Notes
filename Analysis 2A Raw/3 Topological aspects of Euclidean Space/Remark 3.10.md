### [[Remark 3.10]]

It may seem silly to have different names for concepts that are equivalent. However, while they are equivalent for $\R ^n$ (and actually (1) and (3) remain equivalent for metric spaces), these notions of compactness can also be defined for more general topological spaces, and then they are no longer equivalent.
