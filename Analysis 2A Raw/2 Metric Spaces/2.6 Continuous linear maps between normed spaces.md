## 2.6 Continuous linear maps between normed spaces

Recall the definition of linear maps between vector spaces. Given vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ on $\R$, a map $f: X\to Y$ is called linear if for every $\lambda ,\mu \in \R$ and for every $x,y \in X$, we have that

$$ f(\lambda x+ \mu y) = \lambda f(x) + \mu f(y). $$

If $(X,\| \cdot \|_X)$ and $(Y,\|\cdot \|_Y)$ are normed spaces, then they are vector spaces, so we can consider linear maps between them, and continuity is defined as in [[Definition 2.37]], since normed spaces are metric spaces.
