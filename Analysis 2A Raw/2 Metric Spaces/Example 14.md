### Example 14

Consider the space $C^0([0,1])$ of all continuous functions from $[0,1]$ to $\R$ (sometimes it is denoted with $C([0,1])$). Define

$$ d*\infty (f,g) = \max *{t \in [0,1]} |f(t) - g(t)|, \quad f,g \in C^0([0,1]). $$

Then $(C^0([0,1]),d_\infty )$ is a metric space.

Another possible metric on $C^0([0,1])$ can be defined as

$$ d^\ast (f,g) = \int _0^1|f(t)-g(t)|dt. $$

In many of the examples above the distance can be defined in terms of a norm. This is the case for the Euclidean space, but not only.
