### [[Remark 2.56]]

Note that one could have chosen, in the previous example, a function $g:[0,1]\to \R$ as

$$ g(x):= x^7 - x^3 - 20 x + 5, $$

for which the equation (2.2) can be written as a fixed point problem as well, as $x = g(x)$.

However it is easy to see that then $g([0,1]) \nsubseteq [0,1]$, which makes $g$ not admissible.
