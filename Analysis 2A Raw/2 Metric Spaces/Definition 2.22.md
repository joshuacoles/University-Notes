### [[Definition 2.22]]

(Boundary of a set) Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. The **boundary** $\partial A$ of a set $A \subseteq X$ is defined as

$$ \partial A:= \overline A\cap \overline {(X\setminus A)}. $$

Namely the boundary of $A$ is the set of points $x\in X$ (not necessarily in $A$!!) such that every ball $B_r(x)$ contains points of $A$ and of $X\setminus A$.
