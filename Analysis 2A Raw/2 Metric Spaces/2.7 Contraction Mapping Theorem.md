## 2.7 Contraction Mapping Theorem

Many problems can be solved by successive approximations. For example, consider **Newton’s method** for finding a zero of a function $f : \R \to \R$. Assuming that $f$ is differentiable, we choose a point $x_1 \in \R$ and we recursively define

$$ x_{k + 1} = x_k - \frac {f(x_k)}{f’(x_k)}, \quad k = 1,2,3,\ldots $$

Geometrically, this amounts to approximating the graph of $f$ by a tangent line at $(x_k,f(x_k))$ and finding its intersection with the $x$-axis.

In many cases, the sequence $(x_k)_{k \in \N }$ will converge to a zero of $f$ as $k \to \infty$.

In this section, we will see that this is an example of a more general principle, called the **Contraction Mapping Principle** or Banach Fixed Point Theorem.

First of all, we define what we mean by fixed point.
