### Example 17

(Metrics not associated to a norm) Consider the discrete metric in Example 12 and take $X=\R$ (or any vector space on $\R$ containing at least two distinct elements). Then, for any $\lambda \in \R$, with $\lambda \neq 0$ and $|\lambda |\neq 1$, and any $x,y \in \R$ with $x\neq y$, we have that

$$ d(\lambda x, \lambda y) =1, $$

while

$$ |\lambda | d(x,y) = |\lambda | \neq 1. $$

Also the railway metric in Example 13 is not derived from a norm (prove it!).

1 Usually differentiability is defined in an open interval. Here differentiable in the closed interval $[0,1]$ means that it is differentiable in $(0,1)$ and the derivative can be extended up to $[0,1]$ continuously.
