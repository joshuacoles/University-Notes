### Example 30

Consider $\R$ with the usual metric. Let $I_0 = [0,1]$ and define



$$ \begin{align*} I_1 & = \textstyle [0,\frac {1}{3}] \cup [\frac {2}{3},1] \\ I_2 & = \textstyle [0,\frac {1}{9}] \cup [\frac {2}{9},\frac {1}{3}] \cup [\frac {2}{3},\frac {7}{9}] \cup [\frac {8}{9},1], \\ I_3 & = \textstyle [0,\frac {1}{27}] \cup [\frac {2}{27},\frac {1}{9}] \cup \ldots \cup [\frac {8}{9},\frac {25}{27}] \cup [\frac {26}{27},1], \\ & \hspace {6pt} \vdots \end{align*} $$ (In each step, remove the middle third of every interval remaining, but keep the end points; see Figure 4.) Let

$$ C = \bigcap _{k = 0}^\infty I_k. $$

This is called the Cantor set. Every $I_k$ is a finite union of closed sets, and therefore closed. Hence $C$ is an (infinite) intersection of closed sets, which means that $C$ is closed.
