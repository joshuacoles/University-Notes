### [[Theorem 1.34]]

Given the power series $\sum _{k=0}^\infty \alpha _k z^k$ with $\alpha _k, \,z\in \C$, set

$$ L:= \limsup _{k\to \infty } |\alpha _k|^{\frac 1k}, \quad \textrm {and} \quad r=\frac 1L. $$

(If $L=0$, then $r=+\infty$; if $L=+\infty$, then $r=0$.) Then the series converges for $|z|<r$ and does not converge for $|z|>r$.

Concerning the differentiation of complex power series, similar results as in the real case apply. Namely, within a power seriesâ€™ radius of convergence, a power series is differentiable, and its derivative can be obtained by differentiating the individual terms of the power series term by term and has the same radius of convergence.

First of all we need to define the derivative of a complex function as preview of Analysis 2B.
