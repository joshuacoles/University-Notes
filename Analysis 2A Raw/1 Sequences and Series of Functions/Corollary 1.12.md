### [[Corollary 1.12]]

If $\sum _{k=1}^\infty f_k$ is a uniformly convergent series of Riemann integrable functions $f_k : [a, b] \to \R$, then the sum of the series is Riemann integrable and

$$ \int _a^b\sum _{k=1}^\infty f*k(x) dx = \sum *{k=1}^\infty \int _a^b f_k(x) dx. $$

In other words, the series may be integrated term by term (or, equivalently, we can exchange the operations of integration and sum).

Finally, we address the issue of differentiability. It is easy to see that uniform convergence of a sequence of functions $f_k:[a,b] \to \R$ implies nothing about the sequence $(fâ€™_k)_{k\in \N }$.
