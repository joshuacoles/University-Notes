### [[Theorem 1.36]]

Let $f(z)=\sum _{k=0}^\infty \alpha _k z^k$ be a power series with radius of convergence $r>0$. Then $f$ is complex-differentiable for $|z|<r$ (also called holomorphic) and its derivative is equal to the power series $f’(z) = \sum _{k=1}^\infty k \alpha _k z^{k-1}$ obtained by differentiating the series term by term. Also, $f’$ has the same radius of convergence as $f$.
