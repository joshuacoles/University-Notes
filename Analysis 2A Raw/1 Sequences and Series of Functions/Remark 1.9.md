### [[Remark 1.9]]

The continuity of the limit can be phrased in a more suggestive way, in terms of ‘exchange of limits’: for every $x\in [a,b]$:

$$ \lim _{t\to x} \lim _{k\to \infty } f*k(t) = \lim *{k\to \infty }\lim _{t\to x} f_k(t). $$

We will see that this ‘commutativity’ is common to many results related to uniform convergence.

We now address the question of integrability.
