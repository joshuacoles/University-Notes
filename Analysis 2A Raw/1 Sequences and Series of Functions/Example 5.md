### Example 5

The series

$$ \sum _{k=0}^\infty k^k x^k $$

has radius of convergence $r=0$; the series

$$ \sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac {x^k}{k!} $$

has radius of convergence $r=\infty$. The series

$$ \sum _{k=0}^\infty x^k, \quad \sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac {x^k}{(k+1)^2}, \quad \sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac {x^k}{k+1} $$

all have $r=1$. However, the first series does not converge at $x=\pm 1$; the second one converges at both $x=-1$ and $x=1$; the third series converges at $x=-1$ and diverges at $x=1$.

So the endpoints of the interval of convergence of the series have to be checked separately.

The following theorem gives a way of computing the convergence radius of a series:
