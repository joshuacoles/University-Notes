### [[Corollary 1.37]]

A complex power series is infinitely (complex-)differentiable in its disc of convergence, and each of its $m$-th derivatives can be obtained by differentiating the series term-by-term $m$ times. The resulting power series has radius of convergence equal to the original power series.
