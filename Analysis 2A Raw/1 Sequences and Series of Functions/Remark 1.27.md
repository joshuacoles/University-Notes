### [[Remark 1.27]]

Assuming that the radius of convergence of the power series is finite we have deduced uniform convergence in any closed interval contained in the interior of the interval of convergence. If $r=\infty$ then the convergence is not necessarily uniform on the entire line, but it is uniform on any closed interval, using the same arguments as above.
