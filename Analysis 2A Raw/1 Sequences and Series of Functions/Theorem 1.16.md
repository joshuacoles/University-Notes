### [[Theorem 1.16]]

(Differentiation for series) Let $(f_k)_{k\in \N }$ be a sequence of functions $f_k:[a,b]\to \R$ of class $C^1$ in $(a,b)$ and assume that the two series of functions

$$ \sum _{k=1}^\infty f_k \quad \textrm {and} \quad \sum _{k=1}^\infty f_k’ $$

converge uniformly to functions $f$ and $g$, respectively. Then $f$ is differentiable in $(a,b)$, its derivative is continuous in $(a,b)$ and

$$ f’=g. $$

More in general, if the functions $f_k$ are $m$-times differentiable with continuity ($f_k\in C^m(a,b)$) and the series

$$ \sum _{k=1}^\infty f_k, \quad \sum _{k=1}^\infty f*k’, \dots , \textrm {and } \, \sum *{k=1}^\infty f_k^{(m)} $$

converge uniformly to functions $f$, $g_1$,..., and $g_m$, respectively, then $f$ is $m$-times differentiable with continuity in $(a,b)$ and

$$ f^{(i)}=g_i. $$
