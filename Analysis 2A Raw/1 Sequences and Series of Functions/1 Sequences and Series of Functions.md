# 1 Sequences and Series of Functions

In this chapter we combine the major themes in Analysis 1 (sequences & series and functions): We consider sequences and series of functions, and we investigate convergence concepts and properties of the limits.

Let $(f_k)_{k\in \mathbb {N}}$ be a sequence of functions $f_k:A \to \R$, with $A\subset \R$, and let $f:A \to \R$. (Usually, $A$ will be an interval.)
