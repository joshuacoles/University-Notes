## 1.3 Complex sequences and series

We can extend to complex numbers all the definitions and theorems in $\R$ that only rely on the ‘metric structure’ of $\R$ (namely on the fact that we can compute distances among elements in $\R$, with the absolute value), since we have defined a modulus on complex numbers that mimics the absolute value in $\R$.

We will write $(\C , | \cdot |)$ to denote the set of complex numbers

$$ \C := \{z = x+i y: x, y\in \R \}, $$

with the modulus defined as

$$ |z|:= \sqrt {z\bar z} =\sqrt {x^2+y^2}. $$

Note however that we cannot extend to $\C$ the properties studied in $\R$ that rely on the ‘ordering’ of $\R$, since there is no ordering in $\C$.
