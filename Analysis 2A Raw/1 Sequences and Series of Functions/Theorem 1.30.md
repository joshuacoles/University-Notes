### [[Theorem 1.30]]

Assume that the power series (1.4) has radius of convergence $0<r<\infty$ and let



$$ f(x):= \sum _{k=0}^\infty a_k x^k, \quad x\in (-r,r). $$

Then

$$ a_k = \frac {f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}. $$

Proof. By setting $x=0$ we have that

$$ f^{(m)}(0) = m! a_m, $$

namely if a power series converges to a function $f$, then $f$ is infinitely many times differentiable in its interval of convergence and the power series coincides with the Taylor series of $f$.
