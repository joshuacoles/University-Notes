### Example 8

(Complex trigonometric functions) We can define $\cos z$ and $\sin z$ by either using their respective power series, or by declaring

$$ \cos z= \frac {e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2}, \quad \sin z= \frac {e^{iz} - e^{-iz}}{2i}, $$

and using the power series expression of the complex exponential.
