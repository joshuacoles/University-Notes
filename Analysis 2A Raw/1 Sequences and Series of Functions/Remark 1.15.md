### [[Remark 1.15]]

There is another version of [[Theorem 1.13]] under weaker assumptions (only differentiability of $f_k$, no continuity for $f’_k$, but still (i) and (ii)) that guarantees the convergence of the derivatives (but clearly $f’$ will not be continuous in general). The proof however requires more care, as the use of the fundamental theorem is not allowed.

Similarly, for series, one can exchange the operations of derivative and sum, under the following assumptions.
