### [[Remark 1.28]]

Note that if a power series converges for $|x|<r$, then uniform convergence may fail to hold for $|x|<r$. Indeed, the geometric series

$$ \sum _{k=0}^\infty x^k $$

has radius of convergence $r=1$, so it converges for $|x|<1$ to the function $1/(1-x)$ and does not converges for $|x|>1$. The series does not converge at the endpoints.

The series converges uniformly on $[-\rho , \rho ]$ for every $0\leq \rho <1$ but does not converge uniformly on $(-1,1)$, as shown in Example 3.

Also, the series $\sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac {x^k}{k}$ has radius of convergence $r=1$. At $x=1$ it diverges, while at $x=-1$ it converges, but not absolutely. The series does not converge uniformly on $(-1,1)$.

Under the same assumptions as in the [[Theorem 1.26]], we have the following result (which can be proved by induction).
