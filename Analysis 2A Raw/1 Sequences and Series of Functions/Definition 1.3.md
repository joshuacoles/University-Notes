### [[Definition 1.3]]

(Pointwise and uniform convergence for series) Let $(f_k)_{k\in \mathbb {N}}$ be a sequence of functions $f_k:A \to \R$, with $A\subset \R$, and let $s_n:A\to \R$ denote the sequence of partial sums defined as

$$ s*n:= \sum *{k=1}^n f_k, \quad n\in \N . $$

The series $\sum _{k=1}^\infty f_k$ converges pointwise to a function $f$ on $A$ if the sequence $(s_n)_n$ converges to $f$ pointwise on $A$.

The series $\sum _{k=1}^\infty f_k$ converges uniformly to a function $f$ on $A$ if the sequence $(s_n)_n$ converges to $f$ uniformly on $A$.

Uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence. The vice versa is not true in general, as shown in the following examples.
