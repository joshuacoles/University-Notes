### [[Remark 0.4]]

Recall that, for a non-empty set $A\subset \R$, the infimum of $A$ is denoted by $\inf A$ and is the greatest lower bound for $A$. The infimum (which need not lie in $A$) is an element of $\overline {\R }=\R \cup \{+\infty , -\infty \}$ which is less than or equal to any element in $A$ and arbitrarily close to elements of $A$. Similarly, $\sup A$ (which need not lie in $A$) is the least upper bound for $A$ and is an element of $\overline {\R }$ which is greater than or equal to any element in $A$ and arbitrarily close to elements of $A$.

Although not every real sequence converges, we can always define the following notions of limit superior (limsup) and limit inferior (liminf) of a sequence:
