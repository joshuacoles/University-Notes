### [[2.10 Examples of Triple Integrals]]

If the density of a body, $\Omega$, is given by $\rho =\rho (\boldx )>0$, then the mass of the body is given by $\int _\Omega \rho (\boldx ) \,\rd V$. Its centre of mass is the point $\bar {\boldx }=\frac {1}{|\Omega |}\int _\Omega \boldx \rho (\boldx ) \, \rd V$, i.e. a vector in $\R ^3$.
