### [[2.14 Properties of the Gradient]]

If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable scalar fields and $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are constants, then


$$
\nabla (\lambda f + \mu g) = \lambda \nabla f + \mu \nabla g,
$$

and

$$
\nabla (fg) =f \nabla g + g\nabla f.
$$

On inspection one can clearly see the correspondence between these and the standard rules for derivatives. 

#### Proof

- For (1) split into components and use linearity of differentiation.
- For (2) split into components and use the product rule.
