### [[2.15 Directional Derivative]]

Let $\Omega \subset \R ^3$ and $f:\Omega \to \R$ be a differentiable scalar field. For a nonzero vector $\bolda$ in $\R ^3$, the _directional derivative_ of $f$ in the direction $\widehat {\bolda }$ at $\boldx _0 \in \Omega$ is defined by

$$
D_{\bolda } f (\boldx_0) =
\lim_{h \to 0}
\frac{f(\boldx_0 + h \widehat {\bolda }) - f(\boldx_0)}{h}.
$$

Thus by definition, $D_{\bolda } f (\boldx _0)$ is the rate of change of $f$ in the direction $\widehat {\bolda }$ at the point $\boldx _0$.
