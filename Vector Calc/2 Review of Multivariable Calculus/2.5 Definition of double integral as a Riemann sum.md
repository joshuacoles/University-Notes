### [[2.5 Definition of double integral as a Riemann sum]]

Given $\Omega \subset \R ^2$, subdivide $\Omega$ into $N$ subregions $A_1,\ldots , A_N$ with areas $\delta A_1,\ldots ,\delta A_N$. In each of the subregions choose an arbitrary point $\boldx _i$. Then, for any scalar function $f$ on $\Omega$,

$$ \iint _\Omega f(\boldx ) \, \rd A \equiv \lim _{N\rightarrow \infty } \sum _{i=1}^N f(\boldx _i) \, \delta A_i, $$

provided that this limit exists and is independent both of the choice of $\boldx _i$ and of the particular subdivision.

(Double) integration follows the linearity and additivity properties that you are used to from single variable calculus; see your first year lecture notes to review these basic properties. For our purposes, one of the more important properties is the ability to convert between coordinate systems using the Jacobian.
