### [[2.13 Gradient]]

Let $\Omega \subset \R ^3$ and let $f:\Omega \to \R$ be a differentiable scalar field. Then the _gradient_ of $f$ is defined by

$$
\nabla f
= \bolde_x \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
+ \bolde_y \frac {\partial f {\partial y}
+ \bolde_z \frac {\partial f}{\partial z}.
 $$

Note that $f$ is a scalar field while $\nabla f$ is a vector field. The gradient is also sometimes written as $\mathrm{grad}(f)$ or $\mathrm {grad} f$.
