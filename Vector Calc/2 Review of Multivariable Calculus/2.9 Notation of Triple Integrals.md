### [[2.9 Notation of Triple Integrals]]

If $\Omega \subset \R ^3$,

$$ \int _\Omega f(\boldx ) \, \rd V = \iiint _\Omega f(x,y,z) \, \rd x \, \rd y \, \rd z, $$

with the $V$ in $\rd V$ standing for â€œvolume".

We consider triple integrals via the usual definition in terms of a Riemann sum, where the properties of linearity, additivity, evaluation by successive integration, and their definition for vector fields are all analogous to the double-integral case.
