### [[2.18 Gradient is Perpendicular to Contours]]

The gradient, $\nabla f$, is a vector perpendicular to the level sets, $f(\boldx )=c$, where $c$ is constant.

#### Proof

Take a point $\boldx _0$ on the level set $f(\boldx _0) = c$, and a vector $\boldt$ that is tangent to the level set. Then, since $f$ does not change in the direction $\boldt$, the directional derivative $D_{\boldt }f(\boldx _0)=0$. Hence (2.9) implies that $\widehat {\boldt }\cdot \nabla f(\boldx _0)=0$, i.e. $\nabla f(\boldx _0)$ is perpendicular to $\widehat {\boldt }$. As this holds for any tangent vector at $\boldx _0$, we must have that the vector $\nabla f(\boldx _0)$ is perpendicular to the surface. â–¡

### Example

Let $f(\boldx )= x^2 + y^2 + z^2$; then the equation $f(\boldx )= a^2$ (with $a$ constant) defines a sphere of radius $a$. We compute $\nabla f = (2x, 2y, 2z)= 2\boldx$, which is perpendicular (i.e. normal) to the surface of the sphere at every point $\boldx$.
