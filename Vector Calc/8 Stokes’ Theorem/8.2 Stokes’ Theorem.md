### [[8.2 Stokes’ Theorem]]

Let $S$ be a sufficiently smooth, [[7.2 Bounded Domains|Bounded]], [[7.5 Open and Closed Surfaces|Open]], [[5.10 Orientable Surfaces|Orientable]] Surface in $\R^3$, with outward-pointing unit normal vector $\boldn$, and let $C$ be its boundary. Let $S$ and $C$ be [[8.1 Corresponding Orientation between Surfaces and Boundary Curves|Correspondingly Orientated]].

If $\boldF$ is a vector field that is continuously differentiable in a neighbourhood of $S$, then

$$
\iint_S (\curl \boldF ) \dp \rd \boldS =
\oint_C \boldF \dp \rd \boldx,
$$

where $\rd \boldS := \boldn \, \rd S$.

## Connection to [[7.10 Stokes' Form of Green's Theorem in the Plane]]

We have already encountered a version of Stokes’ theorem – in the situation where the surface is a planar area in $\R^2$, Stokes’ theorem reduces to Green’s theorem in the plane, see [[7.10 Stokes' Form of Green's Theorem in the Plane]].

## Proof

We will start by assuming that $S$ has a [[5.4 Parametric Representation]] in terms of $(u,v)$, ie. $\boldx = \boldx (u,v)$, so that $(u,v)\in S_{uv} \subseteq \mathbb {R}^2$.

> For more complicated surfaces where a single parameterisation is either difficult or impossible, we can leverage the Linearity of the Integral to split the region into multiple sections and recombining.

As with the proof for the [[7.6 The Divergence Theorem]], we will attack the problem first in a simplified case considering only one dimension, to later expand this to all dimensions through symmetry arguments.

In this case we notice that if we can prove Stokes’ theorem for

$$
\boldF = \begin{pmatrix}
	F(x,y,z) \\ 0 \\ 0
\end {pmatrix} = F \bolde_x 
$$

then similar proofs apply for $\boldF = F\bolde_y$ and $\boldF = F\bolde_z$. And then, by linearity, the complete result follows.

### Simplified Case

So we proceed now by considering the case $\boldF = F\bolde_x$, i.e. we wish to prove that

$$
\iint_S \begin{pmatrix}
	0 \\
	\pdiff {F}{z} \\
	-\pdiff {F}{y}
\end{pmatrix} \dp \rd \boldS
=
\oint_C F \,\rd x.
$$

> Where the integrand on the LHS is the the [[6.5 Curl]].

The aim here to being to to express both sides of the equation in terms of a parameterisation which will allow us to apply [[7§1 Green's Theorem]] over the resulting integrals in parameter space (a suitable 2D [[7.1 Domains|Domain]]).

#### LHS

We start by considering the surface integral on the LHS, using the parameterisation $\boldx =\boldx (u,v)$. Using [[5.12 Scalar Surface Integrals via a Parametric Representation]] we have

> #todo the theorem is about scalar differentials, we have vector differentials, is this valid?

$$ \begin{align*}
\iint_{S_{uv}} \begin{pmatrix}
	0 \\
	\pdiff {F}{z} \\
	-\pdiff {F}{y}
\end{pmatrix} \dp \rd \boldS

&= \iint_{S_{uv}} \begin{pmatrix}
	0 \\ \pdiff {F}{z} \\ -\pdiff {F}{y}
\end{pmatrix} \dp \(\pdiff {\boldx }{u} \times \pdiff {\boldx }{v} \) \,\rd {u} \,\rd {v} \\

&= \iint_{S_{uv}} \begin{pmatrix}
	0 \\ F_z \\ -F_y
\end{pmatrix} \dp \begin{vmatrix}
	\bolde_x & \bolde_y & \bolde_z \\
	\pdiff {x}{u} & \pdiff {y}{u} & \pdiff {z}{u} \\
	\pdiff {x}{v} & \pdiff {y}{v} & \pdiff {z}{v}
\end {vmatrix} \,\rd u \, \rd v \\

&= \iint_{S_{uv}}
	\pdiff{F}{z}\(\pdiff{z}{u} \pdiff{x}{v} - \pdiff{x}{u} \pdiff{z}{v}\)
	-
	\pdiff{F}{y}\(\pdiff{x}{u} \pdiff{y}{v} - \pdiff{y}{u} \pdiff {x}{v}\)
\,\rd u \, \rd v.
\end{align*}
$$

#### RHS

Now we turn to the line integral on the RHS of the equation. Since $\boldx = \boldx (u,v)$ we can express the differential $\rd x$ in terms of the parameters $\rd u$ and $\rd v$, by the chain rule:

$$
\oint_C F \,\rd x =
\int_{\partial S_{uv}} F \(\pdiff {x}{u} \,\rd {u} + \pdiff {x}{v} \,\rd {v}\).
$$

Now we apply [[7.10 Stokes' Form of Green's Theorem in the Plane]] to the vector field $\(F\pdiff {x}{u}, F\pdiff {x}{v}\)$. This results in ([[#^8-8]]),

$$
\begin{align*}
\oint_C F \,\rd {x}

&= \iint_{S_{uv}}
	\pdiff {}{u} \(F\pdiff {x}{v}\) -
	\pdiff {}{v} \(F\pdiff {x}{u}\)
\,\rd u \,\rd v, \\

&= \iint_{S_{uv}} \left[
	\pdiff {F}{u} \pdiff {x}{v} +
	F \pdiff {{}^2 x}{u\partial v} -
	\pdiff {F}{v}\pdiff {x}{u} -
	F \pdiff {{}^2 x}{v \partial u}
\right] \,\rd u \rd v, \\

&= \iint_{S_{uv}} \left[
	\pdiff {F}{u} \pdiff {x}{v} - \pdiff {F}{v}\pdiff {x}{u}
\right] \,\rd u \rd v.
\end{align*}
$$

^8-8

Finally, we apply the chain rule to compute the derivatives $F_u$ and $F_v$:

$$ \begin{align*} \pdiff {F}{u} & = \pdiff {F}{x}\pdiff {x}{u} + \pdiff {F}{y}\pdiff {y}{u} + \pdiff {F}{z}\pdiff {z}{u},  \\\\ \pdiff {F}{v} & = \pdiff {F}{x}\pdiff {x}{v} + \pdiff {F}{y}\pdiff {y}{v} + \pdiff {F}{z}\pdiff {z}{v}. \end{align*} $$

Substituting these into ([[#^8-8]]) we obtain

$$ \begin{align*} \oint_C F \, \rd {x} &= \iint_{S_{uv}} \( \pdiff {F}{x}\pdiff {x}{u} + \pdiff {F}{y}\pdiff {y}{u} + \pdiff {F}{z}\pdiff {z}{u} \right ) \pdiff {x}{v} - \left ( \pdiff {F}{x}\pdiff {x}{v} + \pdiff {F}{y}\pdiff {y}{v} + \pdiff {F}{z}\pdiff {z}{v} \right ) \pdiff {x}{u} \, \rd {u} \rd {v}. \end{align*} $$

Note that the first term in each set of parentheses $(\ldots)$ cancel, so we are left with

$$ \begin{align*} \oint_C F \, \rd {x} &= \iint_{S_{uv}} \left ( \pdiff {F}{y}\pdiff {y}{u} + \pdiff {F}{z}\pdiff {z}{u} \right ) \pdiff {x}{v} - \left ( \pdiff {F}{y}\pdiff {y}{v} + \pdiff {F}{z}\pdiff {z}{v} \right ) \pdiff {x}{u} \, \rd {u} \rd {v}. \end{align*} $$

This is precisely [[#^8-5]] and so we have established [[#^1]] and proved Stokes’ theorem for the vector field $\boldF (x,y,z)=F(x,y,z) \bolde_x$.

The proofs for the $y$ and $z$ components of a vector field follow similarly, and then the full theorem follows by linearity of integration.
