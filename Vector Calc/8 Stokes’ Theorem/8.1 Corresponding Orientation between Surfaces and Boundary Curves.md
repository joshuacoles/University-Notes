# [[8.1 Corresponding Orientation between Surfaces and Boundary Curves]]

Let $S$ be an open, [[5.10 Orientable Surfaces|Orientable Surface]] with simple boundary curve $C = \partial S$.

Choose a direction for the normal vector $\boldn$ on $S$ (i.e. the ‘outward-pointing’ one). The surface $S$ and the curve $C$ are said to be ‘***correspondingly oriented***’ if an observer on the positive (‘outward’) side of $S$ (i.e. the side that $\boldn$ is pointing into), while travelling around $C$, always has the surface on their left.

## Technical Definition

Slightly more precisely, let,

$$
\boldx_Q, \boldx_R \in C : \text{ if } \boldx(t_Q) = t_Q, \boldx(t_R) = \boldx_R, t_Q \lt t_R,
$$

ie that $\boldx_Q$ and $\boldx_R$ are nearby points on $C$, with $\boldx_Q$ occurring before $\boldx_R$.

Further let $\boldx_P$ be a point on $S$ near to $\boldx_Q$ and $\boldx_R$. Then $S$ and its boundary $C$ are correspondingly oriented if the surface normal $\boldn$ and the vectors $\underline{PQ} = \boldx_Q - \boldx_P$, $\underline{PR} = \boldx_R - \boldx_P$ (in this order) form a ***right-handed triad***, ie,

$$
\boldn \cdot \(\underline{PQ} \times \underline{PR}\) > 0.
$$
