# 9.1 Coordinate-free Definitions of grad, div and curl

## [[9.1 Coordinate–Free Definition of Gradient]]

Recall that in Cartesian coordinates ($x$, $y$, $z$) with respect to the basis vectors $\bolde _x,\bolde _y,\bolde _z$ we deduced in section 4.2 that

$$ \rd f = \pdiff {f}{x} \rd x + \pdiff {f}{y}\rd y + \pdiff {f}{z} \rd z = \nabla f \cdot \rd \boldx . $$

This is really just a statement of the chain rule for differentiation. We can go further and extend this to _define_ of the gradient $\nabla f$ of a scalar function $f$ in any coordinate system that we choose: we define $\nabla f$ to be the vector such that for all incremental changes in position $\rd \boldx$, the change in the function $f$ is given by

$$  \rd f = \nabla f \cdot \rd \boldx . $$

This is extremely useful since it is a _coordinate-free_ definition which therefore enables us to translate it into expressions for the gradient $\nabla f$ in any (orthonormal) coordinate system that we choose. Cartesian coordaintes are only one of many possible choices.

## [[9.2 Coordinate–Free Definition of Gradient]]

[[7.6 The Divergence Theorem]] provides a route to a definition of the divergence $\nabla \cdot F$ that, as with [[9.1 Coordinate–Free Definition of Gradient]], is independent of coordinate system. Let $V$ be a (small) volume, having surface $S=\partial V$ and always containing the point $\boldx _0$. Consider the limit in which the maximum diameter of $V$ tends to zero. Then

$$ \iint _S \boldF \cdot \rd \boldS = \iiint _V \nabla \cdot F \ \rd V = \iiint _V \big ( \nabla \cdot \boldF \rvert _{\boldx _0} + o(|\nabla \cdot \boldF |) \big ) \ \rd V = \nabla \cdot \boldF \rvert _{\boldx _0} |V| + o(|\nabla \cdot \boldF | |V|) $$

where the $o(f(\boldx ))$ terms indicate terms that are second and higher order, and $|V|$ denotes the volume of $V$. Hence we can define

$$  \nabla \cdot \boldF \rvert_{\boldx _0} := \lim _{|V| \rightarrow 0} \frac {1}{|V|} \iint _{\partial V} \boldF \cdot \rd \boldS $$

where $V$ is any small volume containing $\boldx _0$ with a smooth surface $S=\partial V$.

## 9.1 [[Coordinate–Free Definition of Curl]]

Similarly, Stokes’ [[8.2 Stokes’ Theorem]] provides a coordinate-free definition of $\nabla \times \boldF$. Let $S$ be an open smooth surface bounded by a curve $C=\partial S$, and consider a limiting process in which $\boldx _0$ remains on S while its diameter tends to zero and the surface normals tend smoothly to $\boldn (\boldx _0)$. Then

$$ \oint _C \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx = \iint _S \nabla \times \boldF (\boldx ) \cdot \rd S = \iint _S \big ( \nabla \times \boldF \rvert _{\boldx _0} + o(\nabla \times \boldF ) \big ) \cdot \rd \boldS = \nabla \times \boldF \rvert _{\boldx _0} \cdot \boldn |S| + o(|\nabla \times \boldF | |S|) $$

where $|S|$ is the area of $S$. Hence a coordinate-free definition of $\nabla \times \boldF$ is



$$  \boldn \cdot \nabla \times \boldF \rvert_{\boldx _0} := \lim _{|S| \rightarrow 0} \frac {1}{|S|} \oint _C \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx $$

where $S$ is any sufficiently smooth open surface with boundary $C$. Note that this gives the component of $\nabla \times \boldF$ in the direction $\boldn$; all components of $\nabla \times \boldF$ can be deduced by considering limiting surfaces through $\boldx _0$ with normals in different directions.
