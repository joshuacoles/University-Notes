## [[1.3 Cylindrical & Spherical Coordinates]]

- Cylindrical Coordinates will be denoted by $(r,\theta ,z)$ (i.e. plane polar coordinates with a $z$-axis added)
- Spherical Polar Coordinates will be $(r,\theta ,\varphi )$ where
	- $0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi$ is the ‘longitude’ (angle in the $x-y$ plane) 
	- $0 \leq \varphi \leq \pi$ denotes ‘latitude’ (angle measured from the positive $z$-axis, placing the point $x=y=0$, $z=1$ at the ‘North Pole’ of the unit sphere).
	- Different sources may use different conventions for these, in particular for the spherical polar coordinate angles. As you might expect, **digrams** are usually a crucial help in setting up the coordinate systems correctly.
