## [[1.4 Notation for Derivatives & Integrals]]

Similar issues to vector notation can arise when indicating derivatives and integrals. For example for a scalar function $f(x,y,z)$

$$ \pdiff {f}{x} = \partial _x f = f_x $$

The last of these is widely used in some situations and I will endeavour to avoid any confusion with the use of subscripts for indexing (as in (1.1), and see below). And we will often integrate multiple times in the course. I will try to adopt the (slightly cumbersome but usefully explicit) convention that the number of integral signs will correspond to the dimension of the integral. For example:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\int _a^b f(x) \, \rd x & \text { is an integral over an interval in } \ \R
\\
\iint _S f(u,v) \, \rd u \, \rd v & \text { is an integral over (part of) a 2D surface }
\\
\iiint _V f(x,y,z) \, \rd x \, \rd y \, \rd z & \text { is an integral over a 3D volume } \end{eqnarray}
$$

Naturally, the number of $\rd x$â€¯ s written down is a good guide to this but often we will want to use other notation, e.g. $\rd A$, $\rd S$ or $\rd V$, to indicate area, surface and volume integrals so some care will be required in order ensure you are interpreting the notation correctly. **If all else fails, draw a picture!** (and then label it). Fully.
