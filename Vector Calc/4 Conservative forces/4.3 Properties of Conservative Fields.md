### [[4.3 Properties of Conservative Fields]]

The following three statements are equivalent.

1. $\boldF$ is a conservative vector field on a simply connected domain $\Omega$.
2. For every (sufficiently nice) closed curve $C \subset \Omega$,
$$ \oint _C \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx =0.
$$

3. For any two (sufficiently nice) curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ that have the same start and end points $\boldx _a$ and $\boldx _b$,

  

  $$ \int _{C_1} \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx \ = \ \int _{C_2} \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx  $$

The proof proceeds in three parts.

#### Proof

##### (1) => (2)

Using both the fact that $\boldF =\nabla \phi$ for some potential $\phi$ and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for work integrals ([[4.1 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Inner Product Integrals]]), we have

$$ \oint _{C} \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx = \oint _{C} \nabla \phi \cdot \rd \boldx = \phi \big (\boldx (b)\big )-\phi \big (\boldx (a)\big ). $$

However since $C$ is closed, $\boldx (a)=\boldx (b)$, so the above integral is zero. □

##### (2) => (3)
From any two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ as in point 3 above one can construct the closed curve $C=C_1 \cup (-C_2)$ on which (4.3) holds. From that, one can readily deduce (4.4). □

##### (3) => (1)
If (4.4) holds then



$$ \phi (\boldx ):= \int _C \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx $$

is well-defined, say for curves $C$ with start point $\boldx (a)=\boldzero$ and end point $\boldx (b)=\boldx$. Then we verify that such a quantity $\phi$ satisfies $\boldF = \nabla \phi$. The details of proofs of 2 $\Rightarrow$ 3 and 3 $\Rightarrow$ 1 will be discussed further on a Problem Sheet. □
