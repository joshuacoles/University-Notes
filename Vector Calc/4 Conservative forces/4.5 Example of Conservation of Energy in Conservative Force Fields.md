### [[4.5 Example of Conservation of Energy in Conservative Force Fields]]

Let $\boldx (t)$ be the position vector at time $t$ of a particle of mass $m$ moving under a force $\boldF$. Define the curve $C$ to be the particle’s path between $t=a$ and $t=b$. Show that the work integral



$$ W = \int _C \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx , $$

is equal to the change in kinetic energy over the duration of the motion.

**Solution:** The particle velocity is given by $\dot \boldx (t)$ and acceleration is $\ddot \boldx (t)$. By Newton’s Second Law, force = mass $\times$ acceleration, and thus (assuming constant mass)



$$ \boldF (\boldx (t))=m \ddot \boldx (t). $$

The work done in moving the particle along $C$ is



$$  W = \int _C \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx . $$

Hence, using (4.7) and the form (3.9) of the work integral that makes the parameterisation explicit, (4.8) becomes



$$ W= m\int _C \ddot \boldx \cdot \rd \boldx = m\int _a^b \frac {\rd ^2\boldx }{\rd t^2}(t)\cdot \dot \boldx (t)\,\rd t. $$

We recall that

$$ \diff {}{t} \left ( \left | \diff {\boldx }{t}\right |^2\right ) = \diff {}{t} \left ( \diff {\boldx }{t}\cdot \diff {\boldx }{t}\right ) = 2\diff {^2\boldx }{t^2} \cdot \diff {\boldx }{t}, $$

so

$$ \begin{align*} W&= \frac {1}{2} m\int _a^b \diff {}{t} \left ( \left | \dot \boldx (t)\right |^2\right ) \rd t\\ &= \frac {1}{2} m \left | \diff {\boldx }{t}(b)\right |^2- \frac {1}{2} m \left | \diff {\boldx }{t}(a)\right |^2, \end{align*} $$ which is the change in kinetic energy of the particle. We have shown that _work done = change in kinetic energy from $t=a$ to $t=b$._

Hence for motion under a conservative force, and putting signs back in, work done equals the change (increase) in potential energy equals the change (decrease) in kinetic energy, and vice versa, i.e. we have conservation of energy.
