### [[3.10 Line integral of a Scalar Field]]

Let $C$ be a curve with parameterisation $\boldx (t)$ for $a\leq t\leq b$. The _line integral_ of a scalar field $f$ along $C$ is defined by

$$
\int_C f\, \rd s := \int_a^b f(\boldx (t)) \left |\boldx â€™(t)\right | \rd t.
$$

This definition shows that the line integral is well-defined (i.e. takes the same value for different parameterisations of the same curve) and follows naturally from substitution of the Pythagorean expression for the arclength in (3.2) into the integrand $f \, ds$. If the curve $C$ is closed, then we often write the line integral as

$$ \oint_C f\,\rd s. $$
