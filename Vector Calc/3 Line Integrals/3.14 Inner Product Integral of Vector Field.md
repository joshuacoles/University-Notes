### [[3.14 Inner Product Integral of Vector Field]]

Let $C$ be a curve with parametrisation $\boldx (t)$ for $a\leq t\leq b$, and let $\boldF$ be a vector field.

The _Scalar Line Integral_ or Inner Product Integral of the vector field $\boldF$ along $C$ is defined to be

$$
\int_C \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx = \int_a^b \boldF (\boldx (t))\cdot \boldx â€™(t)\, \rd t.
$$

These are also known as *'Work Integrals'*, alluding to their connection to mechanical work in a Force Field.
