### [[3.1 Definition of a Curve]]

A **Curve** in $\R ^3$, typically denoted $C$, is represented by a **piecewise smooth function**,

$$
\boldx : [a,b] \to \R^3.
$$

In component form, we write $\boldx(t) = \left(x(t), \,y(t), \,z(t)\right)$ and call $t$ the **parameter**.

> **Note**: The fact that points on the interval are ordered gives the curve an *orientation*.
