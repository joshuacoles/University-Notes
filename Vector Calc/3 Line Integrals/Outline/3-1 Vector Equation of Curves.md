## 3.1 Vector Equation of Curves

- [[3.1 Definition of a Curve]]

### Properties of Curves

- Boolean Properties
	- [[3.2 Simple Curves]]
	- [[3.3 Closed Cuves]]
- Local Properties
	- [[3.5 Tangent Vector]]
	- [[3.6 Arc Length]]

### Parameterisations

From the definition, there are many ways to parameterisation a curve. 

- [[3.7 Parameterisations of a circle]]

One such parameterisation is in terms of arc length $s$ is often easier and more natural to work with.
