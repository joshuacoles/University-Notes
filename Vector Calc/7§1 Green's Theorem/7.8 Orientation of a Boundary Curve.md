### [[7.8 Orientation of a Boundary Curve]]

Let $D \subset \R ^2$ be a bounded domain in the $(x,y)$ plane such that its boundary curve $C$ is simple and sufficiently smooth. Let $\boldx (t)$, $t\in [a,b]$ be a parameterisation of $C$.

We say that $C$ is ***oriented in the anticlockwise or positive sense*** if as $t$ increases $\boldx (t)$ moves around $C$ in the anticlockwise direction.
