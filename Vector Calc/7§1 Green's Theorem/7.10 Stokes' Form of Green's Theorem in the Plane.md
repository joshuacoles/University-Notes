**Remark:** The ‘divergence theorem’ form of Green’s theorem in 7.9 is equivalent to, but not exactly the same as, the classic formulation of Green’s theorem, which is written in terms of a line integral of $\boldF \cdot \rd \boldx$ around the boundary $C$.

Because in 2D the tangent vector $\boldt$ and the normal vector $\boldwiden$ to a curve are directly related to each other we can in fact turn one formulation into the other just by re-labelling the vector field.

To be precise about this, we suppose that we have parameterised $C$ in the form $\boldx (s)=(x(s), y(s))$ where $s$ is the arclength variable, increasing in the anticlockwise (positive) direction, so that the unit tangent vector $\boldt$ and outward unit normal vector $\boldwiden$ are given explicitly in terms of derivatives of $\boldx (s)$ by

$$  \boldt = \left (\diff {x}{s}, \diff {y}{s}\right ), \qquad \text {and} \qquad \boldwiden = \left (\diff {y}{s}, -\diff {x}{s}\right ). $$

Note that $\boldt \cdot \boldn =0$ as expected. Now we can state the re-labelled result as follows.

# [[7.10 Stokes' Form of Green's Theorem in the Plane]]

Let $D \subset \R ^2$ be a bounded domain such that its boundary curve $C$ is simple, sufficiently smooth, and oriented in the positive sense. Suppose that $\boldF = (F_1, F_2)$ is a vector field in $\R ^2$. Then

$$  \iint _D \left ( \frac {\partial F_2}{\partial x} - \frac {\partial F_1}{\partial y} \right ) \, \rd A =\oint _{C} \boldF \cdot \rd \boldx . $$ ^f971b5

**Proof:** This is a re-labelling of [[7.9 Divergence Form of Green’s Theorem in the Plane]]. Given $\boldF$, define $(p,q)^T = (F_2, -F_1)^T$. Then according to the ‘divergence theorem’ form (7.14),

$$ \iint _D \left ( \pdiff {F_2}{x} - \pdiff {F_1}{y} \right ) \, \rd A = \oint _{C} \left ( \begin {array}{c} \phantom {-}F_2 \\ -F_1 \end {array}\right ) \cdot \left (\begin {array}{c} \phantom {-}\diff {y}{s} \\ -\diff {x}{s} \end {array} \right ) \, \rd {s} = \oint_{C} \left (\begin {array}{c} F_1 \\ F_2 \end {array}\right ) \cdot \left (\begin {array}{c} \diff {x}{s} \\ \diff {y}{s}\end {array}\right ) \, \rd {s}. $$

where we have used the expression for $\boldwiden$ from (7.15) and then re-arranged the right hand side. The integrand in the expression on the right is now precisely $\boldF \cdot \rd \boldx$ by definition 3.12.
