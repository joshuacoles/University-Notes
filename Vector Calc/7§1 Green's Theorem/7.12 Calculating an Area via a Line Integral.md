# [[7.12 Calculating an Area via a Line Integral]]

Let $C\subset \R ^2$ be a simple smooth closed curve that is [[7.8 Orientation of a Boundary Curve|orientated]] in the positive sense. Then the area enclosed by $C$ is

$$
\frac {1}{2} \oint _{C} (-y \bolde _x + x \bolde _y) \cdot \rd \boldx.
$$

## Proof
Let $D$ be the area enclosed by the curve $C$. From,

![[7.10 Stokes' Form of Green's Theorem in the Plane#^f971b5]]

setting $F_1(x,y) = -y$ and $F_2(x,y) = x$, we have

$$
2 \iint_\Omega \,\rd A 
= \oint_C (-y \bolde_x + x \bolde_y) \dp \rd \boldx.
$$

Of which we need only divide by $2$ to complete the proof.
