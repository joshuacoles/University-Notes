# [[7.11 Separated Differentials Form of Green’s Theorem]]

Green’s [[7.10 Stokes' Form of Green's Theorem in the Plane]] is sometimes equivalently written with the differentials separated from each other:

$$ 
\iint_D \(
	\parfrac{F_2}{x} - \parfrac{F_1}{y}
\) \,\rd x \,\rd y
= \oint_C F_1 \,\rd x + F_2 \,\rd y.
$$

## Proof

Take the form as seen in [[7.10 Stokes' Form of Green's Theorem in the Plane]],

![[7.10 Stokes' Form of Green's Theorem in the Plane#^f971b5]]

Writing

$$
\boldF \cdot \rd {\boldx } = \boldF \cdot \diff {\boldx }{s} \, \rd s = F_1 \rd x + _2 \rd y,
$$ 

we see the result evidently.
