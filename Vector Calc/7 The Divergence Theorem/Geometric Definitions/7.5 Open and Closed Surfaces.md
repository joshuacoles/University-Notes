# [[7.5 Open and Closed Surfaces]]

A surface $S \subset \R^3$ is _open_ iff,

$$
\Forall \boldx_1, \boldx_2 \notin S \quad \Exists C: A \to \R^3 : \Forall t \in A, C(t) \notin S
$$

for all $\boldx_1,\boldx_2 \not \in S$ there exists a curve from $\boldx_1$ to $\boldx_2$ which does not cross $S$.

A surface $S \subset \R ^3$ is _closed_ if it is not open.
