# Chapter 5 Surfaces and surface integrals

From the computation of line integrals the natural next step is to study integrals defined over a 2D surface $S$ in $\R ^3$. 

## 5.1 Surfaces

Just as for line integrals, we first need to understand how to describe surfaces which, as in the case of line integrals, we almost always do by parameterising them.

## 5.2 Surface integrals

We now turn to the formulation of integrals over surfaces. First we will start with integrals with scalar differentials.

- [[5.13 Example of Surface Integral, Surface area of a Sphere]]

Which can then be extended to vector differentials, normal to the surface at that point.
