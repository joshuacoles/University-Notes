### [[5.5 Examples of Surface Representations]]

(Example of different representations for a hemisphere).

1. Explicit representation of a hemisphere of radius $a$:
	$$ \set{ (x,y,z) : z= \sqrt {a^2 - x^2 -y^2}}. $$

2. Implicit representation of the hemisphere of radius $a$:
	$$ \set{(x,y,z) : x^2 +y^2 + z^2 -a^2 =0, \ z>0}. $$

3. Parametric representation of the hemisphere of radius $a$:
	$$  \boldx (\theta ,\varphi ) = (a\cos \theta \sin \varphi ,a \sin \theta \sin \varphi , a \cos \varphi ) \quad \\\text { for } \quad 0\leq \theta <2\pi , \quad 0\leq \varphi < \pi /2. $$

A surfaceâ€™s local orientation is indicated by the normal vector to the surface. The simplest case to consider in $\R ^3$ is that of a 2D plane. Recall the following results for 2D planes.
