### [[5.8 Finding Normals to a Surface]]

#### [[5.4 Parametric Representation]]

Suppose that the surface $S$ has the parametric representation

![[5.4 Parametric Representation#^3a15b1]]

A unit normal vector at $\boldx (u_0,v_0)\in S$ is then given by

$$
\widehat{\boldn}(\boldx (u_0,v_0)) =

\left .
\frac{\displaystyle \pdiff{\boldx}{u} \times \pdiff {\boldx}{v}}
{\left |\displaystyle \pdiff {\boldx}{u} \times \pdiff {\boldx}{v}\right|}
\right |_{(u_0, v_0)}. $$

#### [[5.3 Implicit Representation]]

Suppose the surface $S$ has the implicit representation

![[5.3 Implicit Representation#^d3fbbc]]

A unit normal vector at $\boldx \in S$ is then given by



$$  \widehat {\boldn }(\boldx ) = \frac { \nabla F(\boldx ) }{ \left |\nabla F(\boldx )\right | }. $$

##### Proof

This follows immediately from [[2.18 Gradient is Perpendicular to Contours]]; recall that we have already established that $\nabla F$ is orthogonal to tangent vectors to the surface $S$ at $\boldx$.

To prove Point 1, consider the curve $\boldx (u,v_0)$ for a fixed value $v_0$ and varying $u$ is a curve within the surface $S$ that passes through the point $\boldx (u_0,v_0)$. So by [[3.5 Tangent Vector]], the vectors $\pdiff {\boldx }{u}(u_0,v_0)$ and, by the same argument, $\pdiff {\boldx }{v}(u_0,v_0)$ are both tangent to $S$ at the point $\boldx (u_0,v_0)$. Hence their vector product (normalized) yields a unit normal. This result follows after applying Part (b) of [[5.6 Vector Equation of a Plane]]. â–¡

#### [[5.2 Explicit Representation]]

An explicit representation, $z = f(x,y)$ is itself a parameterisation, in this case in terms of $x$ and $y$, $\boldx = (x,y,f(x,y))$.

Then we can compute the normal vector using the formula given for such surfaces above.


$$ \widehat {\boldn }\big (\boldx \big ) = \frac {\displaystyle \pdiff {\boldx }{x} \times \pdiff {\boldx }{y}}{\left |\displaystyle \pdiff {\boldx }{x} \times \pdiff {\boldx }{y}\right |} = \frac {\displaystyle \left ( \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ \pdiff {f}{x} \end {array} \right ) \times \left ( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ \pdiff {f}{y} \end {array} \right ) }{ \left |\displaystyle \left ( \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ \pdiff {f}{x} \end {array} \right ) \times \left ( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ \pdiff {f}{y} \end {array} \right ) \right |} = \frac {1}{\big ((\partial _x f)^2 + (\partial _y f)^2 + 1 \big )^{1/2}} \left ( \begin{array}{c} -\pdiff {f}{x} \\ -\pdiff {f}{y} \\ 1 \end {array} \right ) . $$

#todo Make that... less ugly???

which agrees precisely with the computation (5.8) involving $\nabla F$ where $F(x,y,z)=z-f(x,y)$.
