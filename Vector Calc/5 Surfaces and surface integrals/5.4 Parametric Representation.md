## [[5.4 Parametric Representation]]

The expression of a surface in terms of two independent parameters, making clear the isomorphism of $S$ to $\R^2$.

$$
S = \set{(x(u,v), \, y(u,v), \, z(u,v)) : (u,v) \in D \subseteq \R ^2
} \sub \R^3.
$$

Note we generally take $D$ to be such that the function $\boldx : D \to \R^3$ is **injective**.

## Nonâ€“Uniqueness

This is not unique (even under our assumption of injectivity) as we can restrict can compose any function $f: D' \to D$ such that $\boldx' = \boldx \circ f$ , thus making an equivalent surface under a different parameterisation. For example the following are equivalent, $\Forall \alpha \ne 0$,

$$\boldx (t) = (\cos \alpha t, \sin \alpha t), t \in [0, 2\pi /\alpha)$$
