# [[5.6 Vector Equation of a Plane]]

## [[5.4 Parametric Representation]]

The equation of a plane in $\R ^3$ passing through the point $\boldx _0$ and containing the linearly independent (i.e. non-parallel) vectors $\boldv _1$ and $\boldv _2$ is

$$ 
\boldx = \boldx_0 + \lambda \boldv_1 + \mu \boldv_2, \quad \lambda ,\mu \in \R.
$$

## [[5.3 Implicit Representation]]

Given the [[5.7 Normal Vector of a Surface]] of the plane $\widehat{\boldn}$, we can define the plane as so,

$$
\widehat{\boldn} \cdot (\boldx - \boldx_0) = 0
$$

This will be given as,

$$ 
\widehat {\boldn } = \frac {\boldv _1 \times \boldv _2}{|\boldv _1\times \boldv _2|}. $$
