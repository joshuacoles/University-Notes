### [[5.10 Orientable Surfaces]]

Let $S$ be a smooth surface. At a point $\boldx \in S$, choose one of the 2 unit normals $\widehat {\boldn }$ to be the _outward-pointing_ unit normal vector (i.e. pointing away from the origin). The surface $S$ is _orientable_ if the **outward-pointing direction** at $P$ can then be continued in a unique and continuous way to the entire surface $S$.

Although one normally denotes unit vectors by a hat ( $\widehat {\cdot }$ ), we may from time to time use $\boldn$ (without a hat) to denote the outwards-pointing unit normal to an orientable surface.
