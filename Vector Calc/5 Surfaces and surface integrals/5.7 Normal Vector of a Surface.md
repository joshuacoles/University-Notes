## [[5.7 Normal Vector of a Surface]]

The normal vector is the vector pointing orthogonal to the surface at that point.

They can be found as per [[5.8 Finding Normals to a Surface]]

$$
\widehat{\boldn} =
\frac{\boldv_1 \cp \boldv_2}{|\boldv_1 \cp \boldv_2|}.
$$

Note that if $\widehat {\boldn }$ is a unit normal so is $-\widehat {\boldn }$.

For a general surface $S$ the normal $\widehat {\boldn }=\widehat {\boldn }(\boldx )$ will depend on $\boldx$ as the local orientation of the surface changes. Nevertheless, the idea encapsulated in (5.6) applies also to an infinitesimal patch of surface.
