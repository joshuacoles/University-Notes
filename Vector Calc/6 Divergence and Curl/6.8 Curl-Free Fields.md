### [[6.8 Curl-Free Fields]]

A vector field $\boldF$ is called _curl-free_ or _irrotational_ if $\nabla \times \boldF =\boldzero$ at every point where $\boldF$ is defined.

**Remark:** Divergence measures the local ‘expansion’ of a vector field (i.e. the rate at which vectors locally are pointing away from each other), curl measures the local ‘rotation’ of a vector field. This is indicated in a quantitative way by [[6.2 Computing the Divergence in Cartesian Coordinates]] and [[6.6 Computing the Curl]].

For instance, consider a particle with position $\boldx (t)$ movind with velocity given by $\dot {\boldx } = \boldomega \times \boldx$. Then $\boldx (t)$ moves in a circle in a plane with normal $\boldomega$. The vector $\boldomega$ is then called the angular velocity of $\boldx$. One can show straightforwardly (e.g. by choosing coordinates where the $z$-axis aligns with $\boldomega$ so that $\boldomega =\omega \bolde _z$) that the curl of this velocity field $\boldomega \times \boldx$, i.e. $\nabla \times (\boldomega \times \boldx )= 2\boldomega$. Thus, the curl of the velocity vector equals twice the angular velocity of the particle.
