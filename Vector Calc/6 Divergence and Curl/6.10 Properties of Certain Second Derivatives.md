### [[6.10 Properties of Certain Second Derivatives]]

Provided that $f$ is ***sufficiently nice*** enough for its second partial derivatives to be symmetric, i.e. $\partial ^2 f/\partial x \partial y = \partial ^2 f/ \partial y\partial x$ etc., and similarly for the components $F_i$ of a vector field $\boldF$, then

1. [[6.11 Gradient of Function is Curl Free]], $\curl (\nabla f) = \boldzero$.
2. [[6.12 Curl Fields is Divergence Free]], $\divrg (\curl \boldF ) = 0$.
3. [[6.13 Vector Laplacian]], $\nabla (\divrg \boldF ) - \curl (\curl \boldF ) = \nabla ^2 \boldF$.
