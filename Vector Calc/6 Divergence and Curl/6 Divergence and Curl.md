# 6 Divergence and Curl

Building on [[2-2 Directional Derivatives, Gradients, and Potentials]], we can construct 3 more complex Differentiation constructs, these are,

- Gradient, $\nabla\phi = \boldF$
- Divergence $\nabla \cdot \boldF = \phi$
- Curl, $\nabla \times \boldF = \boldG$

## 6.3 Second Derivatives

Of these, you can combine the various differential operators $\nabla$ (grad), $\nabla \cdot$ (div), and $\nabla \times$ (curl) we can form a variety of different possibilities for second (and indeed higher) derivatives.

These three operators can be combined in a number of ways, leading to a variety of results and new operators. When combining them it is important to consider the type of these operators (eg. if they return or take in scalar or vector fields, etc). For instance $\nabla (\curl \boldF )$ is nonsense as you cannot take the gradient of a vector field.
