### [[6.4 Divergence-Free Fields]]

A vector field $\boldu$ is called _divergence-free_ (or _solenoidal_ or _incompressible_) if $\nabla \cdot \boldu =0$ at every point where $\boldu$ is defined.

**Remark:** Solenoidal tends to be used in the context of electromagnetism, and incompressible in fluid mechanics. Both carry the idea of volumes in $\R ^3$ that would be carried along the vector field maintaining a fixed volume as they are transported around.
