# Coordinate Systems

> Note this is note based on any source material.

A coordinate system $P$ for a real space $S = \R^n$ is defined by a function,

$$
P : \R^m \to S
$$

such that $P$ [[Surjective|Sujects]] onto the whole space $S$. By Algebra 1A and 2A, knowing that a Surjection must contain within it a Bijection, thus we are bound that $m \ge n$ by the [[Rank Nullity Theorem]] (or is this only linear?).

The space of Coordinates in labeled $\mathrm{Dom}(P)$.

Regions $\Omega \sub S$ are associated with coordinate regions $\Omega_P \sub \mathrm{Dom}(P)$ such that $P : \Omega_P \to \Omega$ is Bijective. This is used in coordinate transforms.

The [[1.5 Jacobian Matrix|Jacobian]] is used to move between coordinates (isnt this linear? What happens with non-linear or is it just constants that are linear, need work) cf [[2.7 Jacobian in polar coordinates]] [[2.6 Change of variables of Integration]].

Whereas a [[Basis]] forms a [[Linear Isomorphism]] from $\R^3$ to $\R^3$ as linear vector spaces, a coordinate system is just a surjective map.
