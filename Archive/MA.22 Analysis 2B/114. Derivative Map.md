The Derivative Map is the generalisation of the standard derivative to higher dimensions, it is a linear function in the required dimensions, such that its value it approximates the "slope" at that point, and the whole function $f(x + \d v) \approx f(x) + A\d v$.

In one dimension this clearly becomes the standard line derivative, in two this is a plane – this thinking gives intuitive logic to the observation that the direction of fastest descent, is the opposite of fastest ascent (link this #todo); and also that the contours of constant value are perpendicular to this direction (link this #todo).

The *Derivative Map* is also known as the *Fréchet Derivative*.

## Definition

Suppose,
- ${U \sub \R^n}$ is an [[Open Set]],
- $f: U \to \R^m$ is a function

We say that $f$ is differentiable at $x \in U$ iff there exists a linear map $A : \R^n \to \R^m$ such that,

$$
\lim_{v \in \R^n,~v ~\to~ 0}
\frac{f(x + v) - f(x) - Av}{\|v\|} = 0
$$

^definition

This condition implies that,

$$
f(x + v) \to f(x) + \d f(x)v,
$$

and that this convergence is faster than $\|v\| \to 0$.

## [[114. Derivative Map|Differentiable]] => Existence of the [[111. Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]]

It is a trivial Corollary to prove that if a function $f : U \to \R^m$ is [[114. Derivative Map|Differentiable]] at a given $x \in U$ then it possess all [[111. Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]] at that point. This can be done by considering the definition,

![[114. Derivative Map#^definition]]

and then taking $v = \lambda \vec{e}_i$. Thus it is trivial to show that the traditional definition of the [[111. Partial Derivative|Partial Derivative]], as given by,

![[111. Partial Derivative#^62624c]]

is but a specialisation under the re-addressal of $v \to \vec{0}$ with $h \to 0$, noting $\|v\| = \|v\vec{e}_j\| = h$.

## Relation to the Jacobian
The [[113. Jacobian Matrix|Jacobian Matrix]] is the realisation of the Derivative Map in the standard basis.

### Proof

Suppose as in the definition that $U \sub \R^n$ and $f: U \to \R^m$, such that it is differentiable. It is then implied that the partial
