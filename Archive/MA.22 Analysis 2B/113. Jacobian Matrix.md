Suppose,
- ${U \sub \R^n}$ is an [[Open Set]],
- $f: U \to \R^m$ is a function
	- The components of its result given by $f_i : U \to \R, i \in J_m$ with respect to the [[Standard Basis]].

Given,
- $v \in U$

If all of the components of $f$ with respect to the [[Standard Basis]], $f_i$, have well defined [[111. Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]], the we can define the *Jacobian Matrix* as,

$$
Jf(v) = \begin{pmatrix}
\parfrac{f_1}{x_1}(v) & \cdots & \parfrac{f_1}{x_n}(v) \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\parfrac{f_n}{x_1}(v) & \cdots & \parfrac{f_n}{x_n}(v) \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Generalisation to Arbitrary Bases
The Jacobian is strictly with respect to the standard basis, this concept can expand to arbitrary bases and possibly even to other vector spaces in the [[114. Derivative Map|Deriative Map]].
