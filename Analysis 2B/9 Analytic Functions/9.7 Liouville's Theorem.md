# 9.7 Liouville's Theorem

If an [[9.6 Entire Functions|Entire Function]] is [[Bounded]], then it is constant.

## Proof

If $f : \C \to \C$ is [[9.6 Entire Functions|Entire]], then the estimates from [[9.4 Holomorphic â‡” Analytic]] can be applied in any disk $B_r(z) \subset \C$. For $k = 1$, they give

$$
|f'(z)| \le \frac 1r \max_{w \in \p B_r(z)} |f(w)|.
$$

If $f$ is bounded, then we may choose $M \ge 0$ such that $|f(w)| \le M$ for all $w \in \C$. Then $|f'(z)| \le M/r$ for all $r > 0$.

This can only be true if $f'(z) = 0$ for all $z \in \C$. [[7.4 Holomorphic Function with Zero Derivative is Constant]] then implies that $f$ is constant.
