# [[5.4 Holomorphic Function|Holomorphic]] â‡” [[9.3 Analytic Function|Analytic]]

Suppose that $U \sub \C$ is an [[Open Set]]. A function $f : U \to \C$ is [[5.4 Holomorphic Function|Holomorphic]] if, and only if, it is [[9.3 Analytic Function|Analytic]].

## Proof

From [[9.2 Radius of Convergence of Complex Power Series#^cc1927]] Proposition [9.1](power-series.html#prp:power-series), we conclude that an analytic function is holomorphic.

The converse follows from [[9.4 Power Series Expansion of Holomorphic Functions]].
