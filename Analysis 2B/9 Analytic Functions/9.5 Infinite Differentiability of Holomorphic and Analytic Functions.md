## Infinite Differentiability of Holomorphic and Analytic Functions

Let $U \sub \C$ be an [[Open Set]] and $f : U \to \C$ a [[5.4 Holomorphic Function|Holomorphic Function]].

Then $f$ has derivatives **of any order** (note that Holomorphic only requires first order existence in domain).

For $z_0 \in U$ and $r > 0$ with $\overline{B_r(z_0)} \sub U$, the $k$-th derivative $f^{(k)}$ satisfies

$$
\begin{equation}
f^{(k)}(z_0) =
\frac{k!}{2\pi i} \int_{\partial B_r(z_0)}
	\frac{f(w)}{(w - z_0)^{k + 1}} \rd w. 

\tag{9.3}
\end{equation}
$$

Furthermore,

$$
|f^{(k)}(z_0)| \le \frac{k!}{r^k} \max_{w \in \partial B_r(z_0)} |f(w)|.
$$

## Proof

[[9.4 Power Series Expansion of Holomorphic Functions]] gives a [[Power Series]] expansion of $f$ in $B_r(z_0)$. It follows from [[9.2 Radius of Convergence of Complex Power Series#Third Statement]] that power series are complex differentiable to any order.

We obtain the form for this function, [[#^747597|(9.3)]] by differentiating the Power Series from said expansion, with terms

![[9.4 Power Series Expansion of Holomorphic Functions#^53a265]]

a total of $k$ times.

The estimates for $|f^{(k)}(z_0)|$ now follow from[[6.7 Maximum Attained Integral Inequality]], using the fact that

$$
\left|\frac{f(w)}{(w - z_0)^{k + 1}}\right| \le \frac{|f(w)|}{r^{k + 1}}
$$

for $w \in \p B_r(z_0)$ and $L(\partial B_r(z_0)) = 2\pi r$.
