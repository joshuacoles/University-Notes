# 11.3 Residue

Suppose that $U \sub \C$ is an [[Open Set]] and $z_0 \in \C$ is a point such that $z_0 \notin U$, but there exists $r > 0$ such that $B_r(z_0) \setminus \{z_0\} \sub U$. Let $f : U \to \C$ be a holomorphic function with [[10.1 Laurent Series]] expansion

$$
\begin{equation*} f(z) = \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty a_k (z - z_0)^k \end{equation*}
$$

in $B_r(z_0) \setminus \{z_0\}$. Then $a_{-1}$ is called the _residue_ of $f$ at $z_0$. We write

$$
\begin{equation*} \mathop{\mathrm{Res}}(f, z_0) = a_{-1}. \end{equation*}
$$

In order to find the residue, we don't necessarily need to calculate the full Laurent series. Instead, we can often use tools such as the following.
