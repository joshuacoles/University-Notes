aliases: Directional Derivative
---

The Directional Derivative is the fundamental building block of higher order analysis, and is a key example of the [[III. Maths as Real Paramaterisation of Complex Objects]].

## Definition

Suppose,
- ${U \sub \R^n}$ is an [[Open Set]],
- $f: U \to \R$ is a function

Given,
- $v \in \R^n$
- $x \in U$

Then,

$$
D_vf(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h v) - f(x)}{h},
$$

if it exists is the Directional Derivative.

## Specialisation into the [[111. Partial Derivative|Partial Derivative]]

We can take partial derivatives to be Directional Derivatives along the [[Standard Basis]], eg,

$$
\parfrac{f}{x_j} = D_{\uvec{e}_j}f.
$$
