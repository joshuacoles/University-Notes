# 7.4

Suppose that $U \sub \C$ is a [[6.3 Contour Connected Set|Contour Connected ]] [[Open Set]]. If $f : U \to \C$ is a [[5.4 Holomorphic Function|Holomorphic]] with $f'(z) = 0$ for every $z \in U$, then $f$ is constant.

## Proof

Given any two points $z_1, z_2 \in U$, we choose a contour $\gamma$ in $U$ with initial point $z_1$ and terminal point $z_2$. Then by [[7.3 Fundamental Theorem of Complex Integration]].

$$
f(z_2) - f(z_1) = \int_\gamma f'(z) \rd z = 0
$$

which means that $f$ is constant.
