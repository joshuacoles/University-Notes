# 7.3 Fundamental Theorem of Complex Integration

Suppose that $U \sub \C$ is [[Open Set|Open]] and a [[6.3 Contour Connected Set]] and $f : U \to \C$ is [[Continuous]].

If $f$ has a [[7.1 Primitives|Primitive]] $F : U \to \C$, then for any [[6.1 Contours|Contour]] $\gamma : [a, b] \to U$,

$$
\int_\gamma f(z) \rd z = F(\gamma(b)) - F(\gamma(a)).
$$
^ftci-1

And further if
$$
\int_\gamma f(z) \, dz = 0
$$

for every [[6.1 Contours|Closed Contour]] $\gamma : [a, b] \to U$, then $f$ has a primitive.

## Proof

### First Statement, Contour Integral of Primitive

Suppose that $F$ is a primitive of $f$. By the [[5.3 Chain rule]], we compute

$$
\dd{}{t} F(\gamma(t))
= F'(\gamma(t)) \gamma'(t)
= f(\gamma(t))  \gamma' (t)
$$

at any $t \in [a, b]$ where $\gamma$ is [[5.1 Complex Derivative|Complex Differentiable]] â€” the last statement being given by the defintion of a [[7.1 Primitives|Primitive]]. Hence

$$
\int_\gamma f(z) \rd z
= \int_a^b f(\gamma(t)) \gamma'(t) \rd t
= \int_a^b \dd{}{t} F(\gamma(t)) \rd t
= F(\gamma(b)) - F(\gamma(a)).
$$

Thus proving the [[#^ftci-1|first statement]].

## Second Statement, Existence of Primitive from Closed Contour Integral

For the second statement, we first note that if we are to find a [[7.1 Primitives|Primitive]], it must satisfy the first equation [[#^ftci-1]]. The idea is therefore to use this formula to construct $F$.

To this end, fix an arbitrary point $z_0 \in U$. Given $z \in U$, we then pick a contour $\gamma : [a, b] \to U$ with initial point $z_0$ and terminal point $z$ and set

$$
F(z) = \int_\gamma f(w) \rd w.
$$

But we must show that

1. $F$ is well-defined, i.e., it does not depend on the choice of $\gamma$, and
2. It is actually a [[7.1 Primitives|Primitive]], i.e., $F'(z) = f(z)$ for all $z \in U$.

We show that $F$ is well-defined by considering two contours $\gamma_1 : [a_1, b_1] \to U$ and $\gamma_2 : [a_2, b_2] \to U$ going from our fixed $z_0$ to our variable $z$. Thus we can construct,

$$
\gamma_c = \gamma_1 - \gamma_2
$$

to be a [[6.1 Contours|Closed Contour]] in $U$. Thus we know by [[6.12 Concatenation of Contours]] that we can express the [[6.2 Contour Integral|Contour Integral]] along this [[6.1 Contours|Contour]] as,

$$
\int_{\gamma_c} f(w) \rd w = \int_{\gamma_1} f(w) \rd w - \int_{\gamma_2} f(w) \rd w
$$

which by the premise and $\gamma_c$'s  closed nature we know to be equal to $0$. Thus it follows that $F$ is well-defined, not depending on the choice of the contour.

Finally to show that $F$ is in fact a primitive (ie [[7.1 Primitives#^11dfa8]] holds), choose $r > 0$ such that $B_r(z) \sub U$.

Finally, for $z \in U$, we want to show that $F'(z) = f(z)$. To this end, choose $r > 0$ such that $B_r(z) \sub U$. If we choose a contour $\gamma$ in $U$ with initial point $z_0$ and terminal point $z$, then

$$
\begin{equation*} F(z) = \int_\gamma f(w) \, dw \end{equation*}
$$

by construction of $F$. For any $\tilde{z} \in B_r(z)$, the contour $\gamma + [z, \tilde{z}]$ is in $U$ and has initial point $z_0$ and terminal point $\tilde{z}$. Therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*} F(\tilde{z}) = \int_{\gamma + [z, \tilde{z}]} f(w) \, dw. \end{equation*}
$$

Hence

$$
\begin{equation*} F(\tilde{z}) - F(z) = \int_{\gamma + [z, \tilde{z}]} f(w) \, dw - \int_\gamma f(w) \, dw = \int_{[z, \tilde{z}]} f(w) \, dw. \end{equation*}
$$

That is, we are in the situation of Lemma [7.1](the-fundamental-theorem-of-complex-integration.html#lem:derivative-integral). It follows that $F'(z) = f(z)$.

### Example

Consider $\gamma : [0, 1] \to \C$ with $\gamma(t) = 2 + t + \pi it^5$. What is

$$
\int_\gamma e^z \rd z
$$

We note that $\gamma(0) = 2$ and $\gamma(1) = 3 + \pi i$. The function $z \mapsto e^z$ has the primitive $z \mapsto e^z$. Hence by the above theorem,

$$
\int_\gamma e^z \, dz = e^{3 + \pi i} - e^2 = - e^2(e + 1).
$$
