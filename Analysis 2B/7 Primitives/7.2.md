# 7.2

Given a [[Continuous]] function $f: B_r(z_0) \to \C$ for some $z_0 \in \C, r > 0$. We can define a function,

$$
\begin{gather}
F : B_r(z_0) \to \C \\\\
F(z) = F(z_0) + \int\limits_{[z_0, z]} f(w) \rd w
\end{gather}
$$

for some choice of $F(z_0)$, in which case $F$ is [[5.1 Complex Derivative|Complex Differentiable]] at $z_0$ with

$$ F'(z_0) = f(z_0). $$

## Proof

First note that for $h \in B_r(0) \sub \C$,

$$
\begin{align}
\int_{[z_0, z_0 + h]} f(z_0) \rd w
&= f(z_0) \int\limits_{[z_0, z_0 + h]} \rd w \\
&= f(z_0) L([z_0, z_0 + h]) \\
&= f(z_0) h. \\
\end{align}
$$

^679b87

as $f(z_0)$ is obviously constant. Hence considering the statement we wish to prove (that $F'(z_0) = f(z_0)$) we rephrase it directly in terms of the [[Difference Quotient]] and the desired value,

$$
P = \frac{F(z_0 + h) - F(z_0)}{h} - f(z_0)
$$

where $\lim_{h \to 0}P = 0$ is an equivalent statement of our desired conclusion (cf [[5.1 Complex Derivative#^d3eaee]]). Hence applying the definition of $F$ from above,

$$
\begin{align}
P
&= \frac 1h \(
	  \(F(z_0) + \int\limits_{[z_0, z_0 + h]} f(w) \rd w\)
	- \(F(z_0) + \int\limits_{[z_0, z_0]} f(w) \rd w\)
\) - f(z_0)\\
&= \frac 1h \int\limits_{[z_0, z_0 + h]} f(w) \rd w - f(z_0)\\
&= \frac 1h \(\int\limits_{[z_0, z_0 + h]} f(w) \rd w - hf(z_0)\)\\
&= \frac 1h \int\limits_{[z_0, z_0 + h]} f(w) - f(z_0) \rd w\\
\end{align}
$$

where the final step is an application of the [[#^679b87|observation above]]. Taking the modulus of $P$ and applying [[6.7 Maximum Attained Integral Inequality]] we can bound $P$ to,

$$
|P|
= \left|
		\frac 1h  \int\limits_{[z_0, z_0 + h]} f(w) - f(z_0) \rd w
\right| 
\le \frac 1{|h|} L([z_0, z_0 + h])
    \max_{w \in [z_0, z_0 + h]} |f(w) - f(z_0)|
$$

of which we can see the first two factors cancel out leaving us with,

$$
|P| = \max_{w \in [z_0, z_0 + h]} |f(w) - f(z_0)|
$$

which by [[Continuous|Continuity]] in $f$ we can see that under $h \to 0$ becomes,

$$
|P| = 0
$$

and hence $F'(z_0) = f(z_0)$.

> Note that we express the quantity as $|\square - v| \to 0$ instead of $|\square| \to |v|$ as the former is obviously a stronger condition, implying $\square \to v$, whereas starting from the latter is a much more complex proposition.

## Extension

- The premise of this theorem states that $f$ must be [[Continuous]] over $B_r(z_0)$.
- Therefore it is also continuous over any subject $X \sub B_r(z_0)$
- Let $z_1 \in B_r(z_0)$ be some arbitrary distinct ($z_1 \ne z_0$) complex number in the domain of $f$.
- Define $X = B_{|z_1 - z_0|}(z_1)$ to be the largest open ball surrounding $z_1$ such that $X \sub B_r(z_0)$.
	- We know this set is non-empty as by its construction, $0 < (z_1 - z_0) < r$, with the complex numbers being... compact ??? #todo.
- Hence the restriction of $f|_X$ is fulfills the requirements of the theorem and $F'(z_1) = f(z_1)$.
- Thus
