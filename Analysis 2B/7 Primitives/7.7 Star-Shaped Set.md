## 7.7 Star-Shaped Set

A set $S \sub \C$ is called **Star-Shaped** if there exists $z_0 \in S$ with the property that for any $z \in S$, the line segment $[z_0, z]$ is contained in $S$.

$$
\Exists z_0 \in S \quad\st\quad \Forall z \in S : [z_0, z] \sub S.

This is a restriction on the definition of a [[6.3 Contour Connected Set|Contour Connected Set]] as it requires points be connected by a straight line where a Contour Connected Set need only have a contour.

### Example

The set shown in Figure below is star-shaped, but $\C \setminus \{0\}$ is not.
