# 8.2 Homotopy of closed contours

Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be an open set. Two closed contours $\gamma_1, \gamma_2 \colon [a, b] \to U$ are called _homotopic_ in $U$ if there exists a continuous map $\psi \colon [a, b] \times [0, 1] \to U$ such that

- $\psi(t, 0) = \gamma_1(t)$ and $\psi(t, 1) = \gamma_2(t)$ for all $t \in [a, b]$ and
- $\psi(\cdot, s)$ is a closed contour for every $s \in [0, 1]$ and $\psi(t, \cdot)$ is a contour for every $t \in [a, b]$.

## Null-Homotopic

A closed contour $\gamma \colon [a, b] \to U$ is called Null-Homotopic in $U$ if it is [[8.1 Homotopy|Homotopic]] in $U$ to a constant contour $\gamma_0 : [a, b] \to U$, i.e., a contour with $\gamma_0(t) = \gamma(a)$ for all $t \in [a, b]$.

> I think this means that it is closed and has [[11.1 Winding Number]] equal to $0$ or $1$ for all $z$.

## Example

The contour $\gamma : [0, 2\pi] \to \C$, $t \mapsto e^{it}$, is null-homotopic in $\C$. In order to see this, consider:

$$
\psi(t, s) = se^{it}.
$$
