# 8 The Cauchy Integral Theorem

In this chapter, we want to extend the local Cauchy theorem to more general sets $U$. We will not only remove the assumption that $U$ is star-shaped, but also allow sets with holes. Example [7.4](the-local-cauchy-theorem.html#exm:pole) shows, however, that we cannot expect primitives in general in this case even for holomorphic functions. Instead, we look for conditions such that

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_\gamma f(z) \, dz = 0 \end{equation*}
$$

for closed contours $\gamma$, or equivalently, such that

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_{\gamma_1} f(z) \, dz = \int_{\gamma_2} f(z) \, dz \end{equation*}
$$

for a pair of contours $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ with identical initial and terminal points.

## Homotopy

The idea of deforming one contour into another is at the centre of this chapter. This can be formalised as follows.

[[8.2 Homotopy of closed contours]]

## Cauchy Theorem

We can now extend [[7.8 Local Cauchy Theorem]] as follows.

[[8.3 Cauchy Integral Theorem]]

One of the consequences of this Theorem is the following useful formula.
