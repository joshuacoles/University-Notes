## 10.1 Laurent Series

Let $z_0 \in \C$, a **Laurent Series** centred at $z_0$ is a series of the form 

$$ \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty a_k (z - z_0)^k $$

We split a Laurent series into the _Power Series Part_ 

$$\sum_{k = 0}^\infty a_k (z - z_0)^k$$

and the _Principal Part_ 

$$\sum_{k = -\infty}^{-1} a_k (z - z_0)^k.$$

### Convergence

We say that the Laurent Series **Converges** at a point $z \in \C$ if **both** the power series part and the principal part converge at $z$.

Instead of a single radius of convergence as for power series, convergence for Laurent series is characterised by *two radii*.

You will show in an exercise that there exist $r, R \in [0, \infty) \cup \set{\infty}$ such that the Laurent Series $\sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty a_k (z - z_0)^k$,

- Converges absolutely for all $z \in \C$ with $r < |z - z_0| < R$
- Diverges when $|z - z_0| < r$ or $|z - z_0|> R$.

Furthermore, the convergence is uniform in any [[Definition 3.5|Compact Set]] $C \subset B_R(z_0) \setminus \overline{B_r(z_0)}$.
