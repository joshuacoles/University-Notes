# Partial Derivative

The underlying idea here is to pretend that we're still dealing with functions of one variable. This is effectively the case if we fix the values of all but one of the variables, chosen as the components with respect to the [[Standard Basis]] (or for [[#Use for Multivariable Functions|multivariable functions]]).

Let $U \sub \R^n$ be an [[1.1 Analytic Space]] and $x \in U$. Suppose that $f : U \to \R$ is a given function and $j \in \{1, \dots, n\}$. Then 

$$
\begin{align}
\parfrac{f}{x_j}(x)
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + he_j) - f(x)}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{h} \bigl(
	f(x_1, \dots, x_j + h, \dots, x_n) -
	f(x_1, \dots, x_n)
\bigr)
\end{align}
$$

if it exists, is the **Partial Derivative** of $f$ with respect to $x_j$ at the point $x$.

## Example

Consider $f \colon \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x) = x_1^2 x_2 + x_3$. Then 

$$
\parfrac{f}{x_1}(x) = 2x_1 x_2, 
\quad
\parfrac{f}{x_2}(x) = x_1^2,
\quad
\parfrac{f}{x_3}(x) = 1.
$$
^example

Thus finding partial derivatives is no different in principle from differentiating a function of one variable.

## Relation to the [[1.3 Directional Derivative]]

The Partial Derivative can be considered a specialisation of the [[1.3 Directional Derivative]] along the [[Standard Basis]] vectors $e_i$.


## Use for Multivariable Functions

The Partial Derivative is also used for functions in the form $f(x, y, \dots)$ where it is notated with respect to the name of the argument differentiated against, for example $\parfrac{f}{y}$. This is most used when dealing with functions outside of a purely analytic context.

## Use in Thermodynamics

Where the number of variables exceeds the number of [[Degrees of Freedom]] (ie your variables are not [[Linearly Independent]] when forming a "[[Basis]]" of states), you will generally seen partial derivatives denoted,

$$
\(\parfrac{U}{T}\)_{V}
$$

where it is the suffix subscript variables which are kept constant in the differentiation. #todo this requires more research.
