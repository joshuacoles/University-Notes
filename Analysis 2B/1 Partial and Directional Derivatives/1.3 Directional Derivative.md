# Directional Derivative

The [[1.3 Directional Derivative|Directional Derivative]] is the most generic extension of the [[Difference Quotient]] to an arbitrary [[Normed Vector Space]]. It, in the grand tradition of mathematics, restricts the problem we are dealing with one of a single real parameter by considering how the function behaves along the line $\set{x + t v : r \in \R} \sub U$ for some $x \in U$ and $v \in \R^n$. Allowing us to define,

$$
D_vf(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + hv) - f(x)}{h},
$$ 

which, if it exists, is the [[1.3 Directional Derivative|Directional Derivative]] of $f$ at $x$ in the direction of $v$. 

A specialisation of this concept for [[Vector Space|Vector Spaces]] with a [[Standard Basis]] is the [[1.2 Partial Derivative]].

## Examples

### Eg. 1

Consider the function $f(x) = x_1^2 x_2 + x_3$. Let $x = (1, 1, 0)$ and $v = (1, 2, -1)$. Then 

$$
f(x + tv) = f(1 + t, 1 + 2t, -t) = (1 + t)^2 (1 + 2t) - t.
$$

Differentiating at $t = 0$, we obtain $D_v f(x) = 3$.

In this particular example, we can check that 

$$
D_v f(x) = v \dp \nab f(x).
$$

The same equation is true for a lot of other examples, but not always. We will see later how this relationship comes about under certain assumptions.

### Eg. 2: Failure under certain conditions

Consider the function $f : \R^2 \to \R$ given by 

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
	\frac{x_1 |x_2|}{\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}} & \text{if $x \neq 0$,} \\
	0 & \text{if $x = 0$.}
\end{cases}
$$

Then we see that $f(x_1, 0) = 0$ for all $x_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $f(0, x_2) = 0$ for all $x_2 \in \mathbb{R}$. Therefore, we conclude that $\nab f(0) = 0$.

Now we consider the directional derivatives $D_v f(0)$ for vectors $v \in \R^2 \setminus \set{0}$. We compute

$$
f(tv) = \frac{t v_1 |v_2|}{\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}}.
$$

(This is also true for $t = 0$, as then both sides vanish.) Hence

$$
D_v f(0, 0) = \frac{v_1 |v_2|}{\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}}.
$$
