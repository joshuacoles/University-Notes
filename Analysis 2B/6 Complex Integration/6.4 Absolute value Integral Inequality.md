# 6.4 Absolute value Integral Inequality

Let $a, b \in \R$ with $a < b$ and let $f : [a, b] \to \C$ be [[Continuous]]. Then

$$
\left|\int_a^b f(t) \rd t\right| \le \int_a^b |f(t)| \rd t.
$$

## Proof

Define the value of the integral as,

$$
I = \int_a^b f(t) \rd t.
$$

In the case that $I \in \R$ then this follows promptly from properties of [[Real Integrals]], and is hence the base case we wish to reach. To achieve this consider instead $|I|^2$, which we can trivially see is a real property.

$$
|I|^2 
= \conj{I} I
= \conj{I} \int_a^b f(t) \rd t
= \int_a^b \conj{I} f(t) \rd t
$$

Hence applying the inequality in real integrals to the final form we obtain,

$$
\int_a^b \conj{I} f(t) \rd t
\le \int_a^b |\conj{I} f(t)| \rd t
=   \int_a^b |\conj{I}| |f(t)| \rd t
= |I| \int_a^b |f(t)| \rd t
$$

giving us finally,

$$
|I|^2 \le |I| \int_a^b |f(t)| \rd t
$$

which since $|I| = 0 \in \R$ is accounted for in the beginning step, gives us the initial inequality,

$$
\left|\int_a^b f(t) \rd t\right| \le \int_a^b |f(t)| \rd t,
$$

as needed.
