# Integrals of Uniformly Convergent Complex Functions is Convergent

Let $U \sub \C$ be an open set and $\gamma : [a, b] \to U$ a [[6.1 Contours|Contour]]. Set $\Gamma = \gamma([a, b])$ to be the Curve of the contour.

Let $(f_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of continuous functions $f_k : U \to \C$ and let $f : U \to \C$ be another continuous function. If $f_k \to f$ is [[Uniformly Continuous]] on $\Gamma$ as $k \to \infty$, then

$$
\int_\gamma f(z) \rd z
= \lim_{k \to \infty} \int_\gamma f_k(z) \rd z.
$$

This is the complex companion of a previously seen (but at this point unwritten) inequality in the real numbers #todo.

## Proof

Define $M_k = \max_{z \in \Gamma} |f_k(z) - f(z)|$. Then by the uniform convergence, we know that $\lim_{k \to \infty} M_k = 0$. [[6.7 Maximum Attained Integral Inequality]] then implies that

$$
\begin{equation*} \left|\int_\gamma f_k(z) \, dt - \int_\gamma f(z) \, dz\right| = \left|\int_\gamma (f_k(z) - f(z)) \, dz\right| \le M_k L(\gamma) \to 0 \end{equation*}
$$

as $k \to \infty$.
