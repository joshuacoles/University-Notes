# 6.11 Invariance of the Contour Integral under Reparametrisation

While the [[6.2 Contour Integral|Contour Integral]] is defined in terms of the [[6.1 Contours|Contour]], not the corresponding curve, it actually depends on the specific parametrisation only in a very weak way.

If we know the curve and the **orientation** of the parametrisation, then the integral is determined. This allows us to think geometrically and illustrate contours with pictures.

In the following, suppose that $U \sub \C$ is an open set and $f : U \to \C$ a [[Continuous]] function. If we have a [[6.1 Contours|Contour]] $\gamma : [a, b] \to U$ and a continuously differentiable, strictly increasing function $\phi : [\tilde{a}, \tilde{b}] \to [a, b]$ (for some $\tilde{a}, \tilde{b} \in \R$ with $\tilde{a} < \tilde{b}$), then $\tilde{\gamma} = \gamma \circ \phi$ is also a contour in $U$. If $\phi(\tilde{a})= a$ and $\phi(\tilde{b}) = b$, then

$$
\int_{\tilde{\gamma}} f(z) \,\d z = \int_\gamma f(z) \,\d z.
$$

Reparametrisations that reverse the orientation do not have this property. Given a contour $\gamma : [a, b] \to U$, we define $-\gamma : [-b, -a] \to U$ by $-\gamma(t) = \gamma(-t)$. Then it is easy to check that

$$
\int_{-\gamma} f(z) \,\d z = - \int_\gamma f(z) \,\d z.
$$
