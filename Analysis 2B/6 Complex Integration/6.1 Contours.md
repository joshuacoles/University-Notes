# Contours

A **Contour** is a function $\gamma : [a, b] \to \C$ (where $[a, b] \sub \R$), that is Piecewise Continuously Differentiable in the following sense,

- $\gamma$ is continuous on $[a, b]$
- There exist $t_0, t_1, \dots, t_K \in [a, b]$ such that $a = t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_K = b$ and $\gamma$ is continuously differentiable in $(t_{k - 1}, t_k)$
- and $\gamma'$ has a continuous extension to $[t_{k - 1}, t_k]$ for every $k = 1, \dotsc, K$.

The point $\gamma(a)$ is called the _initial point_ and $\gamma(b)$ is called the _terminal point_ of the contour. We say that the contour is _closed_ if $\gamma(a) = \gamma(b)$. For a set $S \sub \C$, we speak of a contour _in $S$_ if $\gamma([a, b]) \sub S$.

These can be seen as Parameterisations of a given [[3.1 Definition of a Curve|Curve]], with the same initial and terminal points. See [[6.10 Curve of the Contour]]

## Shorthand Notation

The following notation will be convenient. Given $z, w \in \C$, we write $[z, w]$ for the contour $[0, 1] \to \C, t \mapsto tw + (1 - t)z$. This contour has initial point $z$ and terminal point $w$ and takes values in the line segment between them.

## Circular Contour

A useful Contour we will see frequently in the following topics is the Closed Circular Contour of radius $r$ around the point $z_0 \in \C$,

$$
\begin{gather}
\gamma : [0, \pi] \to \C \\
\gamma(t) = z_0 + r \e^{it}
\end{gather}
$$

## Example

Let $\gamma : [-1, 1 + \pi] \to \C$ be defined by

$$
\begin{equation*} \gamma(t) = \begin{cases} t & \text{if $-1 \le t \le 1$}, \\ e^{i(t - 1)} & \text{if $1 < t \le 1 + \pi$}. \end{cases} \end{equation*}
$$

Then $\gamma$ is a closed contour as $\gamma(1 + \pi) = e^{i\pi} = -1 = \gamma(-1)$.
