# The Hessian Matrix

Let $U \sub \R^n$ be open. Suppose that $f : U \to \R$ is a function that has second order partial derivatives at a point $x \in U$. Then the $(n \times n)$-matrix

$$
\begin{equation*} Hf(x) = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1^2}(x) & \cdots & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_n}(x) \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n \partial x_1}(x) & \cdots & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n^2}(x) \end{pmatrix} \end{equation*}
$$

is called the **Hessian Matrix** (or simply _Hessian_) of $f$ at $x$.

## Relation to the [[1.5 Jacobian Matrix|Jacobian]] and the [[1.4 Gradient]]

The Hessian of a function $f : \R^n \to \R$  is the [[1.5 Jacobian Matrix|Jacobian]] of its [[1.4 Gradient]].
