# 5 Complex Differentiation

We now consider functions of one _complex_ variable with complex values.

There is a [[Bijective]] map $\R^2 \to \C$ with $(x, y) \mapsto x + iy$, and the complex plane inherits the [[Metric Space]] structure from $\R^2$ from this identification.  The notions of balls (also called disks in this context), open/closed sets, or convergence in $\C$ come from this structure. For example, for $z = x + iy \in \C$ and $r > 0$, we have the disk $B_r(z) = \{w \in \C : |w - z| < r\}$.

# 5.1 The complex derivative

The definition of the derivative for functions of a complex variable is quite similar to functions of one real variable.
