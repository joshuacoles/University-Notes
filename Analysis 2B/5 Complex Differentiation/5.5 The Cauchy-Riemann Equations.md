# The Cauchy-Riemann equations

With the usual identification of $\C$ and $\R^2$, a function of one complex variable gives rise to a function of two real variables. Although the complex derivative is different from the derivative for functions of two real variables, there is still a connection.

Let $U \sub \C$ be an [[Open Set]] and define $V \sub \R^2$ to be the corresponding set under this identification, given as,

$$
V = \set{(x, y) \in \R^2 : x + iy \in U}.
$$

Suppose that $f : U \to \C$ and $u, v : V \to \R$ are functions such that

$$
\begin{equation*} f(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y), \quad (x, y) \in V. \end{equation*}
$$

Then for $z = x + iy \in U$, the following are equivalent.

1. The function $f$ is [[5.1 Complex Derivative|Complex Differentiable]] at $z$.
2. The functions $u, v$ are [[2.1 Derivative|Real Differentiable]] at $(x, y)$ and satisfy the **Cauchy-Riemann Equations**
$$
\parfrac{u}{x} = \parfrac{v}{y},
\qquad
\parfrac{u}{y} = -\parfrac{v}{x}.
$$

> Note these are similar to the requirements for an [[4.7 Exact Differential of a Scalar Function]].

If these conditions are satisfied, then

$$
f'(z) = \parfrac{u}{x}(x, y) - i \parfrac{u}{y}(x, y). 
$$

Another way to formulate the Cauchy-Riemann equations is to consider the vector-valued function,

$$
\begin{gather}
F : V \to \R^2 \\\\
F : \pmat{x \\ y} \mapsto \pmat{u(x, y) \\ v(x, y)}
\end{gather}
$$

Then the equations are satisfied if, and only if, the [[1.5 Jacobian Matrix|Jacobian Matrix]] of $F$ at $(x, y)$ is of the form

$$
JF(x, y) = \pmat{
	a & -b \\
	b & a
}
$$

> Hmm, similarities in the form to the rotation matrix, fun.

for some $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$.

## Proof

First assume that $f$ is [[5.1 Complex Derivative|Complex Differentiable]] at $z = x + iy \in U$ with $f'(z) = a + ib$. Writing $h = k + i\ell$ and define

$$
R(h) = \frac{f(z + h) - f(z)}{h} - f'(z), \quad h \in (U - z) \setminus \set{0}.
$$

Then $\lim_{h \to 0} R(h) = 0$ and it follows

$$
f(z + h) = f(z) + hf'(z) + hR(h).
$$
^eq-5-2

Expanding this be in term of $u$ and $v$, we can write the above equation as follows,

$$
\begin{align*}
u(z + h) =
u(x + k, y + \ell) & = u(x, y) + ak - b\ell + \Re(hR(h)), \\
v(z + h) =
v(x + k, y + \ell) & = v(x, y) + bk + a\ell + \Im(hR(h)).
\end{align*}
$$

Thus for the linear operators $A, B : \R^2 \to \R$, given by,

$$
\begin{gather}
A(k, \ell) = ak - b\ell \\
B(k, \ell) = bk + a\ell
\end{gather}
$$ 

we can express the $hR(h)$ as,

$$
\begin{align}
\Re(hR(h)) &= u(x + k, y + \ell) - u(x, y) - A(k, \ell) \\
\Im(hR(h)) &= v(x + k, y + \ell) - v(x, y) - B(k, \ell)
\end{align}
$$

which when divided by $|h|$ gives us the following under $h \to 0 \implies \|(k, \ell)\| \to 0$,

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{u(x + k, y + \ell) - u(x, y) - A(k, \ell)}{\|(k, \ell)\|} &= \Re\(\frac{h}{|h|} R(h)\) \to 0 \\

\frac{v(x + k, y + \ell) - v(x, y) - B(k, \ell)}{\|(k, \ell)\|} &= \Im\(\frac{h}{|h|} R(h)\) \to 0
\end{align*}
$$

This means that $A = du(x, y)$ and $B = dv(x, y)$. In terms of partial derivatives, this is

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x, y) & = a, \quad & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}(x, y) & = -b, \tag{5.3} \\ \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}(x, y) & = b, & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}(x, y) & = a. \tag{5.4}
\end{align}
$$

^eq-5-3-4

Which we can trivially see are the Cauchy-Riemann equations discussed above, and that [[#^eq-5-1]] holds.

Conversely, suppose that $u, v$ are [[2.1 Derivative|Real Differentiable]] and the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold at $(x, y)$. Then there exist $a, b \in \R$ such that [[#^eq-5-3-4|above partial derivative relations]] hold true. Reversing the above steps, we can then find a function $R$ such that [[#^eq-5-2]] holds true and $\lim_{h \to 0} R(h) = 0$. This means that $f$ is complex differentiable at $z = x + iy$.

## Example

Consider the exponential function $\exp : \C \to \C$ defined by

$$
\exp(z) = \e^z = \e^{x + iy} = \e^x(\cos y + i\sin y),
\quad z = x + iy \in \C.
$$

We write $u(x, y) = e^x \cos y$ and $v(x, y) = e^x \sin y$. We compute

$$
\begin{align*}
 \parfrac{u}{x}(x, y) &= e^x \cos y, 
&\parfrac{u}{y}(x, y) &= -e^x \sin y \\
 \parfrac{v}{x}(x, y) & = e^x \sin y,
&\parfrac{v}{y}(x, y) & = e^x \cos y.
\end{align*}
$$

The **Cauchy-Riemann Equations are** satisfied everywhere, so this function is holomorphic in $\mathbb{C}$. We also see that $\exp'(z) = \exp(z)$.

We may now also define $\cosh z = \frac{1}{2}(e^z + e^{-z})$ and $\sinh z = \frac{1}{2} (e^z - e^{-z})$. The algebra of derivatives then gives $\cosh'(z) = \sinh(z)$ and $\sinh'(z) = \cosh(z)$.

Finally, we define $\cos z = \frac{1}{2} (e^{iz} + e^{-iz})$ and $\sin z = \frac{1}{2i} (e^{iz} - e^{-iz})$. These functions are now defined for every $z \in \mathbb{C}$. If restricted to $\mathbb{R}$, they coincide with the familiar cosine and sine. By the algebra of derivatives, they are holomorphic with $\cos'(z) = - \sin(z)$ and $\sin'(z) = \cos(z)$.
