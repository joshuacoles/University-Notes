## 5.2 Algebra of Complex Derivatives

Let $U \sub \C$ be an [[Open Set]] and $f, g : U \to \C$ two functions. Suppose that $z \in U$ such that $f$ and $g$ are [[5.1 Complex Derivative|Complex Differentiable]] at $z$. Then

1. $f + g$ is differentiable at $z$ with $(f + g)'(z) = f'(z) + g'(z)$,
2. $fg$ is differentiable at $z$ with $(fg)'(z) = f'(z) g(z) + f(z) g'(z)$, and
3.  if $g(z) \neq 0$, then $f/g$ is differentiable at $z$ with
    $$
\(\frac{f}{g}\)'(z) = \frac{f'(z) g(z) - f(z) g'(z)}{(g(z))^2}.
$$

For proof we follow the same arguments as the real [[Algebra of Derivatives]].
