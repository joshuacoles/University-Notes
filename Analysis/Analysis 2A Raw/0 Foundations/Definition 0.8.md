### [[Definition 0.8]]

(Convergence of a series) Let $(\alpha _k)$ be a sequence of real numbers, then the series

$$ \sum _{k=1}^\infty \alpha _k $$

is said to **converge** to the sum $s\in \R$ if and only if the sequence of partial sums $(s_n)_{n\in \N }$ defined by

$$ s*n=\sum *{k=1}^{n} \alpha _k \ \ \forall n\in \N $$

converges to $s$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$.

The series $\sum _{k=1}^\infty \alpha _k$ is said to be **absolutely convergent** if $\sum _{k=1}^\infty |\alpha _k|$ is a convergent series. A series which is convergent but not absolutely convergent is said to be **conditionally convergent**.
