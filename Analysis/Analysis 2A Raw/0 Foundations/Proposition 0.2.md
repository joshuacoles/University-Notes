### [[Proposition 0.2]]

(Cauchy criterion for convergence) The sequence $(\alpha _k)_{k\in \N }$ converges if and only if for each $\epsilon >0$, there exists $N$ such that

$$ |\alpha _k -\alpha _l| < \epsilon \ \ \forall k,l \geq N. $$

In computing limits of real sequences, it is helpful to remember some basic examples:
