## 2.4 Completeness

Why do we generally do calculus in $\R$ and not in $\Q$ (the rational numbers)?

The space $\Q$ has ‘holes’, which means that many of the usual results would not hold. For example, the intermediate value theorem: the function $f(x) = x^3 - 2$ satisfies $f(0) = -2$ and $f(2) = 6$, but there is no $x \in \Q$ such that $f(x) = 0$ (because $\sqrt [3]{2}$ is not rational).

Moreover, sequences in $\Q$ might have a limit in $\R \setminus \Q$, as in the case of

$$ \left (1+\frac 1n\right )^n \to e \quad \textrm {as } n\to \infty . $$

The following concept can be used to rule out ‘holes’ of this sort.
