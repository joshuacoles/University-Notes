### Example 16

(Norms on spaces of functions) The distance in Example 14 can be defined via the norm given, for $f \in C^0([0,1])$, by

$$ \|f\|:= \max _{t \in [0,1]} |f(t)|. $$

This norm is usually denoted with $\|f\|_{\infty }$ and referred to as the infinity-norm or sup-norm. (We will see a connection between this norm and uniform convergence.)

In $C^0([0,1])$ one can also define $L^p$-norms, for $p\geq 1$, as

$$ \|f\|_p:= \left (\int _0^1|f(t)|^p dt\right )^{\frac 1p}, $$

for $f\in C^0([0,1])$. Then $(C^0([0,1]), \|\cdot \|_p)$ is a normed space.

Another example of a normed space is the space $C^1([0,1])$ of continuously differentiable functions in $[0,1]$1, with norm defined as

$$ \|f\|_{C^1}:= \max _{t \in [0,1]} |f(t)| + \max _{t \in [0,1]} |f’(t)| = \|f\|_{\infty }+\|f’\|_{\infty }. $$
