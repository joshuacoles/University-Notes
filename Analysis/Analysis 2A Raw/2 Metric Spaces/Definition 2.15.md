### [[Definition 2.15]]

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $A \subseteq X$. A point $x_0 \in X$ is called a **cluster point** (or an ‘accumulation point’, or a ‘limit point’) of $A$, if for all $r > 0$,

$$ (B_r(x_0) \backslash \{x_0\}) \cap A \not = \emptyset . $$

The set of all cluster points of $A$ is denoted by $A’$.

A point $x_0 \in A$ is called an **isolated point** of $A$, if $x\in A$ and there exists $r > 0$ such that

$$ (B_r(x_0) \backslash \{x_0\}) \cap A = \emptyset . $$

In other words, the point $x_0$ is a cluster point of $A$ if it has points of $A$ other than itself arbitrarily close. It is an isolated point if it is in $A$ but is not a cluster point of $A$.

Note that a cluster point may be contained in $A$ or not, while an isolated point is contained in $A$.
