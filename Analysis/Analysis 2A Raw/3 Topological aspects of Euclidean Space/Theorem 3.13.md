### [[Theorem 3.13]]

Let $(K_\lambda )_{\lambda \in \Lambda }$ be a family of compact sets in $\R ^n$ such that the intersection of every finite sub-family is nonempty. Then the intersection

$$ \bigcap _{\lambda \in \Lambda } K_\lambda $$

is nonempty.

Proof. Fix an element $K_{\lambda ^*}$ of the family and assume, for contradiction, that no point of $K_{\lambda ^*}$ belongs to every $K_{\lambda }$.

Then the family $\{U_\lambda : \lambda \in \Lambda \}$, for $U_\lambda := \R ^n\setminus K_\lambda$, is an open cover of $K_{\lambda ^*}$. Since $K_{\lambda ^*}$ is compact, it has a finite sub-cover $\{U_{\lambda _1}, \dots , U_{\lambda _N}\}$.

This however implies that

$$ K*{\lambda _1}\cap \dots \cap K*{\lambda _N}\cap K_{\lambda ^\*} = \emptyset , $$

contradicting the assumption.

A useful corollary is the following:
