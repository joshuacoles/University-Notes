### [[Lemma 3.7]]

(Closed subsets of a compact set) Let $n \in \N$, let $F\subset K\subset \R ^n$, and assume that $F$ is closed and $K$ is a compact set. Then $F$ is compact.

Proof. Let $\{U_\lambda : \lambda \in \Lambda \}$ be an open cover of $F$. Since $F$ is closed, then $\R ^n\setminus F$ is open, and hence

$$ \{U_\lambda : \lambda \in \Lambda \}\cup (\R ^n\setminus F)=: \Phi $$

is an open cover of $K$. As $K$ is compact, we can extract a finite subcover $\Psi$ of $K$ which will also be a subcover of $F$. If the set $\R ^n\setminus F$ is a member of $\Psi$, we may remove it from $\Phi$, and still have a finite cover of $F$, which is also a subcover of $\{U_\lambda : \lambda \in \Lambda \}$.
