### [[Definition 1.19]]

Let $f:[a,b]\times \R \to \R$ be a given function. We say that $f$ is partially differentiable in $t$ at the point $(x_0,t_0)\in (a,b)\times \R$ if the following limit exists:

$$ \lim _{h\to 0} \frac {f(x_0,t_0+h) - f(x_0,t_0)}{h}; $$

In this case we set

$$ \frac {\partial f}{\partial t} (x*0,t_0) = \lim *{h\to 0} \frac {f(x_0,t_0+h) - f(x_0,t_0)}{h}, $$

and we say that $\frac {\partial f}{\partial t} (x_0,t_0)$ is the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $t$ at $(x_0,t_0)$.
