### [[Remark 1.7]]

(Absolute convergence) If uniform convergence of a series is proved by means of the Weierstrass $M$-test, then the series also converge absolutely, namely

$$ \sum _{k=1}^\infty |f_k(x)| <\infty \quad \forall \, x\in A. $$

(Thus the Weierstrass $M$-test is not applicable to series that converge uniformly but not absolutely.)

Note that uniform convergence does not imply absolute convergence: Consider the trivial example

$$ f_k:\R \to \R , \quad f_k(x) = \frac {(-1)^{k+1}}{k}. $$

Then $\sum _k f_k$ converges on $\R$ to the constant function $f(x)=c=\log 2$, uniformly since the series does not depend on $x$, but the convergence is not absolute.
