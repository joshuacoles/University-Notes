## 1.2 Power series

A special type of series of functions is given, for $y\in \R$, by the power series:



$$  \sum _{k=0}^\infty a_k(y-y_0)^k, \quad a_k \in \R , y_0\in \R , $$

or, with no loss of generality (e.g. by setting $x=y-y_0$),



$$  \sum _{k=0}^\infty a_k x^k. $$

Obviously the series (1.4) converges at $x=0$. This could be the only point where the series converges, as for example in the case of the series

$$ \sum _{k=0}^\infty k^k x^k. $$

using the vanishing test.
