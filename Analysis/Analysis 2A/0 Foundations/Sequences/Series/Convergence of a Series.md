### [[Convergence of a Series]]

Let $(a_k)$ be a [[Real Sequence]] then the series,

$$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k $$

is said to **converge** to the sum $s \in \R$ if and only if the sequence of partial sums $(s_n)_{n\in \N}$ defined by

$$ s_n=\sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k \; \Forall n \in \N $$

converges to $s$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$.

The series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \alpha _k$ is said to be **absolutely convergent** if $\sum _{k=1}^\infty |\alpha _k|$ is a convergent series. A series which is convergent but not absolutely convergent is said to be **conditionally convergent**.
