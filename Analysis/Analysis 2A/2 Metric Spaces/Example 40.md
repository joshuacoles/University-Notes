### Example 40

Consider the metric subspace $\Q$ of $\R$. Consider the sequence $(x_k)_{k \in \N }$ in $\Q$ with

$$ x_k = \max \left \{ \frac {i}{k}: i \in \N \,\textrm { with } i^2 < 2k^2\right \}. $$

This is the largest fraction less than $\sqrt {2}$ with denominator $k$, and so we always have

$$ \sqrt {2} - \frac {1}{k} < x_k < \sqrt {2}. $$

In particular, we have

$$ |x_m - x_k| < \frac {1}{N} $$

when $m,k \ge N$. It follows that $(x_k)_{k \in \N }$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\Q$. But is does not have a limit in $\Q$. Hence $\Q$ is not complete.
