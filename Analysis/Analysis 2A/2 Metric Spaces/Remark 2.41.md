### [[Remark 2.41]]

A contraction is automatically Lipschitz continuous, but the condition is stronger than Lipschitz continuity, because we require that $\alpha < 1$. To understand the meaning of the name, ‘contraction’, just note that by definition, a ball of radius $1$ would be mapped inside a ball of radius $\alpha <1$, namely the set shrinks under the action of $f$.
