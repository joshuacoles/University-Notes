### [[Lemma 2.10]]

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. Let $x_0 \in X$ and $r > 0$. Then $B_r(x_0)$ is open.

Proof. Let $x \in B_r(x_0)$. Set $s = r - d(x,x_0)$. Then $s > 0$. Moreover, we have $B_s(x) \subseteq B_r(x_0)$. It follows that $B_r(x_0)$ is open.

We now prove some properties for open sets.
