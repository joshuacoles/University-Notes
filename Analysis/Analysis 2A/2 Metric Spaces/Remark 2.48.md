### [[Remark 2.48]]

From [[Theorem 2.46]] it follows that the image of a bounded set under a linear and continuous operator is also bounded. Because of this property, continuous linear operators are also known as bounded operators.

It is easy to show that $L(X,Y)$ is a real vector space. We can then define a norm on it.
