### Example 21

Consider $C^0([0,1])$ with the usual metric

$$ d*\infty (f,g) = \max *{t \in [0,1]} |f(t) - g(t)| \quad (=\|f-g\|_\infty ) $$

defined in Example 14.

Let $f_0 \in C^0([0,1])$. A graphical representation of the ball $B_r(f_0)$ is given in Figure 3.

Figure 3: The thick solid curve represents the graph of a function $f_0 \in C^0([0,1])$. The open ball $B_r(f_0)$ is given by all functions with graphs contained in the grey region (not including the upper and lower boundary).

We can then define what it means for a set to be bounded.
