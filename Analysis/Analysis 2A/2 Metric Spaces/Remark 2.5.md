### [[Remark 2.5]]

A normed space $(X,\|\cdot \|)$ is a metric space, with the distance

$$ d(x,y):= \|x-y\|, \quad x,y\in X. $$

(The triangle inequality comes from the axiom (N3) of the norm.)

The vice versa is not true! A metric associated with a norm is special: It has the additional properties that for all $x, y, z \in X$ and $\lambda \in \R$

$$ d(x + z,y + z) = d(x,y), \quad d(\lambda x,\lambda y) = |\lambda | \, d(x,y), $$

which are called translation invariance and homogeneity, respectively. These properties do not even make sense in a general metric space since we cannot add points or multiply them by scalars. If $X$ is a normed vector space, we always use the metric associated with its norm, unless stated specifically otherwise.
