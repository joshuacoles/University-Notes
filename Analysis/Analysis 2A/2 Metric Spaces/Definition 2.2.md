### [[Definition 2.2]]

A real vector space is a nonempty set $X$ on which two operations are defined, addition in $X$

$$ + : X\times X \to X $$

and multiplication by an element in $\R$

$$ \cdot : \R \times X \to X $$

satisfying the following axioms:

- • The addition is associative and commutative, namely

  $$ x+y = y+x, \quad (x+y)+z = x+y+z \quad \forall \, x,y,z \in X; $$

- • There exists an element $0\in X$ such that $x+0=x$ for every $x\in X$;
- • $0\cdot x = 0$ and $1\cdot x= x$ for every $x\in X$;
- • Addition and multiplication are distributive, namely

  $$ (\lambda +\mu )x = \lambda x+ \mu x, \quad \lambda (x+y) = \lambda x+ \lambda y \quad \forall \, x,y \in X, \lambda ,\mu \in \R ; $$

- • For every $\lambda , \mu \in \R$ and every $x\in X$:

  $$ \lambda (\mu x) = (\lambda \mu ) x. $$

The vector space is called complex if the multiplication is defined with elements of $\C$.

On vector spaces one can define a _norm_, which is essentially a way to measure to magnitude of the elements in the vector space.
