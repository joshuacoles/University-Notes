### [[Definition 2.6]]

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. Let $x_0 \in X$ and $r > 0$. Then

$$ B_r(x_0) = \{x \in X: d(x_0,x) < r\} $$

is called the **open ball** of centre $x_0$ and radius $r$, whereas

$$ \overline {B}_r(x_0) = \{x \in X: d(x_0,x) \leq r\} $$

is called the **closed ball** of centre $x_0$ and radius $r$.
