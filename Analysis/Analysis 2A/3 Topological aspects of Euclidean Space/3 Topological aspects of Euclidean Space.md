# 3 Topological aspects of Euclidean Space

In this last section we focus on a very special metric space (normed space in fact): $(\R ^n, \|\cdot \|)$ with the Euclidean distance, which we sometimes denoted with $\|\cdot \|_2$. We will state and prove some results that generalise similar results in one dimension, and give indications about extensions to the case of more general metric spaces.

## 3.1 Compactness and convergence

Consider the following statements for intervals of the form $[a,b]$ with $a < b$.

- (1) If $f : [a,b] \to \R$ is continuous, then it attains its minimum and its maximum (Weierstrass’s extreme value theorem).
- (2) If $(x_k)_{k \in \N }$ is a sequence in $[a,b]$, then there exists a subsequence with a limit in $[a,b]$ (Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem).

Both statements do not remain true if $[a,b]$ is replaced by, say, $(a,b)$ or $[a,\infty )$. The underlying property that distinguishes intervals of this form is called compactness. In this section, we discuss compactness in $\R ^n$ (this concept can be generalised to metric spaces with minor changes).

## 3.2 Compactness via coverings

We now introduce another notion of compactness. It is characterised not in terms of sequences, but in terms of the following concept of ‘coverings’.
