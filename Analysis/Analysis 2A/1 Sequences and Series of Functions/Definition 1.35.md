### [[Definition 1.35]]

Let $A\subset \C$ and let $z_0\in A$ and $R>0$ be such that $B_R(z_0)=\{z\in \C : |z-z_0|<R\}\subset A$. A function $f:A\to \C$ is said to be (complex-)differentiable at $z_0$ if the limit

$$ \lim _{z\to z_0}\frac {f(z)-f(z_0)}{z-z_0} $$

exists; in that case we set

$$ fâ€™(z*0):= \lim *{z\to z_0}\frac {f(z)-f(z_0)}{z-z_0}, $$

and call it the derivative of $f$ at $z_0$.

Now we can state the differentiability result for complex power series.
