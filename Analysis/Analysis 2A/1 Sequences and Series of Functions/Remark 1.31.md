### [[Remark 1.31]]

(Taylor series) It is however important to stress that a function $f$ may have derivatives of all orders, and at the same time the series $\sum _{k=0}^\infty a_k x^k$, with $f^{(k)}(0) = k! a_k$, may not converge to $f$ for $x\neq 0$.

The typical example is the function $f:\R \to \R$ defined as

$$ f(x) = \begin {cases} e^{-1/x^2} \quad &\textrm {if } \, x\neq 0,\\ 0 \quad &\textrm {if } \, x= 0. \end {cases} $$

The function $f$ has derivatives of all orders at $x=0$, and $f^{(m)}(0)=0$ for every $m\in \N$.

An immediate consequence of [[Theorem 1.30]] is the following Proposition:
