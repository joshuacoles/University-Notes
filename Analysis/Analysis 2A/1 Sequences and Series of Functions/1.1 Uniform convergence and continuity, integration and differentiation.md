## 1.1 Uniform convergence and continuity, integration and differentiation

One of the main questions in relation to convergence of sequences and series is whether important properties of the functions $f_k$, like continuity, integrability and differentiability, are preserved in the limit process. Also, what is the relation between $f’_k$ and $f’$, or between the integral of $f_k$ and the integral of $f$?

First of all, the uniform limit of continuous functions $f_k:[a,b]\to \R$ is continuous. On the other hand, pointwise convergence does not preserve continuity. (See Example 1)
