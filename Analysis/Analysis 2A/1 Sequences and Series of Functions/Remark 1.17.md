### [[Remark 1.17]]

Again, the conclusion of [[Theorem 1.16]] is valid under weaker assumptions. Indeed it is enough to have convergence of the series $\sum _{k=1}^\infty f_k(x_0)$ for some $x_0\in (a,b)$ and uniform convergence of the series of derivatives, in the spirit of [[Theorem 1.13]].

As a last result, we analyse the ‘exchange’ of integration and differentiation. We first need some preparation.

Let $f:[a,b]\times \R \to \R$, $(x,t)\mapsto f(x,t)$. The function $f$ depends on two variables. We can extend to such $f$ the concepts of continuity, uniform continuity and differentiability that we introduced for functions of one variable.
