# Some basic concepts

Analysis is the theory of limits and the concepts dependent on limits, including derivatives and integrals. In this course, we will see a mathematically rigorous development of the theory. This means that all statements will be accompanied by proofs, based on logical arguments. For this reason, we first discuss the basic elements of logic, followed by other notions that the theory depends on.
