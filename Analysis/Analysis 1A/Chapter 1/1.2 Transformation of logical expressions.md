# Transformation of Logical Expressions

These are laws about how to manipulate complex chains of conjunctions and disjunctions.

- [[Logical Distributive Laws]]
- [[De Morgan’s Laws]]
- [[Contrapositive]]

## Example

What is the negation of the statement $P \implies Q$ ?

We first recall that $\neg  P \lor Q$ is another way to write $P \implies Q$ . Then by De Morgan’s law,

$$
\neg (\neg P \lor Q) \iff \neg (\neg P) \land \neg Q.
$$

But $\neg (\neg P) \iff P$ . Hence

$$
\neg (P \implies Q) \iff P \land \neg Q.
$$

That is, $P \land \neg Q$ is another way to express $\neg (P \implies Q)$.
