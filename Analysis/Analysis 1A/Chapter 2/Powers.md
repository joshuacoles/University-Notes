# Powers

In addition to the arithmetic operations $+$ and $\times$ , we have powers of real numbers. These are defined as follows. For $a \in \R$ and $n \in \N$ ,

$$
a^{n} = \underset{n\text{ times }}{\underbrace{a \dots a}} .
$$

Earlier we have seen the notation $a^{- 1}$ for the multiplicative inverse. We further define

$$
a^{-n} = (a^{-1})^n
$$

for $n \in \N$ , as well as $a^{0} = 1$ . Then we have powers $a^{i}$ for every integer $i \in \Z$ , provided that $a \neq 0$ . With these definitions, we have the following properties of powers.

1.  $a^{i j} = (a^{i})^j$ for all $a \in \R \setminus \set{0}$ and $i, j \in \Z$ .
2.  $(a b)^i = a^i b^i$ for all $a, b \in \R \setminus \set{0}$ and $i \in \Z$ .
3.  $a^{i + j} = a^i a^j$ for all $a \in \R \setminus \set{0}$ and $i , j \in \Z$ .

You are probably familiar with powers with rational (and perhaps real) exponents, too. Later on, we will rigorously develop the theory of powers of the form $a^{x}$ for $a > 0$ and for every real number $x$.
