# The Real Numbers

We take an axiomatic approach to the real numbers here. That is, we first state their basic properties, or axioms. These may be taken as self-evident and are not proved. Later on, however, we will prove any further statements by reducing them to these axioms. The axioms are presented in several groups, each of which correspond to a specific aspect of the theory.

First we start with the [[Field Axioms]] which we then complement with the [[Order Axioms]] and finally the [[Completeness Axiom]] from which we derive the [[Archimedean Postulate]].

In addition to standard field operations we can also define the concept of natural [[Powers]].
