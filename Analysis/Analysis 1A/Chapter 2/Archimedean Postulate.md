# Archimedean Postulate
%%### Theorem 2 (Archimedean Postulate).%%

For any real number $a \in \R$ there exists $n \in \N$ with $a < n$ .

#### Proof

We give a proof by contradiction. If this were false, then we would have a number $a \in \R$ such that $n \leq a$ for all $n \in \N$ . Then $a$ is an upper bound for the set $\N$ ; or in other words, $\N$ is bounded above. Therefore, the supremum $\sup \N$ exists. Moreover, by Theorem 22, there exists $n \in \N$ with $n > \sup \N - 1$ . But then $n + 1 > \sup \N$ , which is a contradiction, as $n + 1 \in \N$ . â–¡
