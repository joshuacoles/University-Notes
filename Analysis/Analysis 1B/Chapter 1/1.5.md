# 1.5 The intermediate value theorem

## Theorem 1.30 (Intermediate Value Theorem).

Let $a,b \in \R$ satisfy $a<b$, $f:[a,b]\to \R$ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and suppose that $f(a) < f(b)$. Then, for all $y \in (f(a),f(b))$ there exists $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f(c)=y$.

#### Proof

Let $y \in (f(a),f(b))$ and define

$$
A = \{ x \in [a,b] \ : \ f(x) \leq y \} .
$$

Then $A$ is a bounded set and is non-empty because $a\in A$.

Let

$$
c = \sup A ,
$$

and observe that $c\in [a,b]$, because $a\in A$, so $a\leq c$ and, since $b$ is an upper bound of $A$, $c \leq b$.

We claim that $f(c) \leq y$. Indeed, by a property of the supremum, for all $n\in \N$ there exists $x_n \in A$ such that $0 \leq c-x_n \leq \frac {1}{n}$, so that $c = \displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }x_n$. Since $x_n \in A$, $f(x_n) \leq y$. By continuity, $f(c) = \displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }f(x_n) \leq y$.

Now we claim that $f(c) = y$. Assume by contradiction that $f(c) < y$. We note that $c < b$, because otherwise $c=b$ and $f(c) = f(b) > y$. From the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ definition of continuity with $\varepsilon = \frac {y-f(c)}2>0$, we get $\delta >0$ such that if $x\in [a,b]$ and $|x-c|\ < \delta$ then

$$
|f(x)-f(c)| < \varepsilon .
$$

From this inequality we find that for $x\in [a,b]$ with $|x-c|< \delta$ we have

$$
f(x)< f(c) + \varepsilon = f(c) + \frac {y-f(c)}2 = \frac {y+f(c)}2 < y,
$$

because $f(c)<y$. This implies that

$$
c = \sup A \geq \min (c+\delta /2,b) > c,
$$

a contradiction.

A similar result holds if $f(a)>f(b)$ (consider $-f$), or for functions defined over an open interval.
