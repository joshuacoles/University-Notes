# 1.3 Continuity

In this section we define the notion of continuity of a function $f:D\to \R$ at a point $c\in D$, where $D\subset \R$. The idea is that $f$ is continuous at $c \in D$ means that the difference $f(x) - f(c)$ can be made arbitrarily small provided that $x\in D$ is sufficiently close to $c$.

## Definition 1.18

Let $f\colon D\to \R$ with $D\subset \R$ and let $c \in D$. Then, $f$ is called _continuous at $c$_ if for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that

$$
\forall x\in D, \quad |x-c|<\delta \ \Longrightarrow \ |f(x)-f(c)|<\varepsilon .
$$

$f$ is called continuous on $D$ if it is continuous at each point of $D$.

### Example 1.19

Let $f:(0,1)\to \R$, $f(x)=1/x$. Show that $f$ is continuous on $(0,1)$.

### Solution

Let $c\in (0,1)$. Given $\varepsilon >0$, suppose that $x\in (0,1)$ and $|x-c|<\delta$ for some $\delta >0$ to be determined. We have

$$
|f(x)-f(c)|=\left |\frac {1}{x}-\frac {1}{c}\right |=\frac {|x-c|}{xc}.
$$

We need an upper bound for $1/x$, which we obtain by bounding $x$ strictly away from $0$. If $\delta \leq c/2$ and $|x-c|<\delta$, then

$$
-(x-c)\leq |x-c|<\delta \leq c/2\Longrightarrow c/2<x\Longrightarrow 0<\frac {1}{x}<\frac {2}{c}.
$$

Substituting this bound above,

$$
|f(x)-f(c)|<\frac {2}{c^2}|x-c| , \quad \text {if } |x-c|<\delta .
$$

Thus, if we assume in addition that $\delta \leq \frac {c^2 \varepsilon }{2}$, then $|f(x)-f(c)|<\varepsilon$.

Recalling the assumptions we made on $\delta$, we choose

$$
\delta =\min \Big ( \frac {c}{2}, \frac {c^2 \varepsilon }{2} \Big ) .
$$

Then, if $x \in (0,1)$ and $|x-c|<\delta$ we have

$$
|f(x)-f(c)| < \varepsilon .
$$

Thus $f$ is continuous at $c$. As $c\in (0,1)$ was arbitrary, $f\colon (0,1)\to \R$ is continuous.

### Example 1.20

Suppose $f:\R \to \R$ and that $|f(x)|\leq |x|$ for all $x\in \R$. Show $f$ is continuous at $0$.

### Solution

At $x=0$, the condition $|f(x)|\leq |x|$ implies that $|f(0)|\leq |0|=0$. Hence, $f(0)=0$. We show Definition 1.18 is satisfied. Given $\varepsilon >0$, let $\delta :=\varepsilon$. Then,

$$
|x-0|<\delta \Longrightarrow |x|<\varepsilon \Longrightarrow |f(x)|<\varepsilon \Longrightarrow |f(x)-f(0)|<\varepsilon .
$$

Hence, $f$ is continuous at $0$.

## Theorem 1.21 (Sequential characterisation of continuity).

Let $f:D\to \R$ where $D\subset \R$ and let $c \in D$. The following statements are equivalent

(a) $f$ is continuous at $c$.

(b) For all sequences $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty \subseteq D$, if $\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty } x_n=c$, then $\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty } f(x_n)=f(c)$.

### Proof

We prove (a) $\Longrightarrow$ (b). By Definition 1.18, given $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta >0$ such that

$$
\forall x \in D \quad |x-c|<\delta \ \Longrightarrow \ |f(x)-f(c)|<\varepsilon .
$$

Let $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty \subseteq D$ satisfy $\displaystyle \lim _{n \to \infty } x_n = c$. Then, there exists $N \in \N$ such that, for all $n \geq N$,

$$
|x_n-c|<\delta .
$$

Hence, for all $n \geq N$,

$$
|f(x_n)-f(c)|<\varepsilon ,
$$

and we conclude that $\displaystyle \lim _{n \to \infty } f(x_n) = f(c)$.

We prove (b) $\Longrightarrow$ (a). Suppose that (b) is true, but (a) is false. If (a) is not true, then there exists $\varepsilon >0$ such that for all $\delta >0$, if there is $x_\delta \in D$ such that $|c-x_\delta |<\delta$ and

%%\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{5}%%

$$
\begin{align} \label {11b} |f(x_\delta )-f(c)| \geq \varepsilon . \end{align}
$$

We consider $\delta _n=1/n$, for $n\in \N$. Then

$$
0<|c-x_{\delta _n}|<\delta _n \quad \text {and}\quad |f(x_{\delta _n})-L| \geq \varepsilon .
$$

Let us write $x_n = x_{\delta _n}$. Since $|x_n-c|<\frac {1}{n}$ we see that $\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty } x_n = c$. By (b) we get that $\lim _{n\to \infty }f(x_n) = f(c)$. Therefore there exists $N\in \N$, such that for $n\geq N$ $|f(x_n)-f(c)| < \varepsilon$. But this contradicts (1.6) and this finishes the proof.

### Remark

Statement (b) of Theorem 1.21 is an alternative characterisation of continuity. This establishes the equivalence of Definition 1.18 with the sequential definition of continuity given in the first semester of the unit.

## Theorem 1.22

Let $f:D\to \R$ and let $c\in D$ be such that $D$ is a punctured neighbourhood of $c$. The following two statements are equivalent:

(a) $f$ is continuous at $c$.

(b) $\displaystyle \lim _{x\to c}f(x)=f(c)$.

### Proof

(a) $\Longrightarrow$ (b)

By Definition 1.18, given $\varepsilon >0$, there exists $\delta >0$ such that

$$
\forall x \in D \quad |x-c|<\delta \Longrightarrow |f(x)-f(c)|<\varepsilon .
$$

This implies

$$
\forall x \in D \quad 0<|x-c|<\delta \Longrightarrow |f(x)-f(c)|<\varepsilon .
$$

which is Definition 1.3 with $L=f(c)$.

(b) $\Longrightarrow$ (a)

Applying Definition 1.3 with $L=f(c)$, given $\varepsilon >0$, there exists $\delta >0$ such that

$$
\forall x\in D \quad 0<|x-c|<\delta \Longrightarrow |f(x)-f(c)|<\varepsilon .
$$

For $x = c$ we have $|f(x)-f(c)|=0<\varepsilon$. Therefore,

$$
\forall x \in D \quad |x-c|<\delta \Longrightarrow |f(x)-f(c)|<\varepsilon ,
$$

and this shows that $f$ is continuous at $c$. □

## Theorem 1.23 (Algebra of continuous functions).

Let $f,g:D\to \R$ be continuous at $c\in D$, and let $\alpha \in \R$. Then the following functions are continuous at $c$:

1.  $f+g$,

2.  $\alpha f$,

3.  $fg$.

4.  If $g(c) \neq 0$, $\dfrac {f}{g}$ is continuous at $c$.

### Proof

The continuity of $f$ and $g$ at $c$ is equivalent to the sequential continuity by Theorem 1.21. If $(x_n)_n$ is a sequence in $D$ and $\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty } x_n = c$, then we know by the sequential continuity of $f$ and $g$ that $\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty } f(x_n) = f(c)$ and $\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty } g(x_n) = g(c)$. By algebra of convergent sequences $\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty } f(x_n) + g(x_n)= f(c)+ g(c)$ and hence $f+g$ is continuous at $c$ (using Theorem 1.21 again).

Similarly, $\alpha f$, $f g$ and $f/g$ (if $g(c)\not =0$) are sequentially continuous at $c$.

## Definition 1.24 (Composition of functions).

Let $g:D \to \R$ and $f:E\to \R$ be such that $g(x) \in E$ for all $x\in D$. Then, $f \circ g: D \to \R$ is defined by

$$
(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)), \quad \forall x \in D.
$$

### Example 1.25

Consider $f:\R \to \R$, $f(y):=3y^2+5$, and $g:\R \to \R$, $g(x):=1+\sin (x)$. Then,

%%\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{6}%%

$$
\begin{align*} (f\circ g)(x) & =3(1+\sin (x))^2+5 , \quad x \in \R , \\ (g\circ f)(y) &=1+\sin (3y^2+5) , \quad y \in \R . \end{align*}
$$

## Theorem 1.26 (Composition of continuous functions).

Let $g:D \to \R$ and $f:E\to \R$ be such that $g(x) \in E$ for all $x\in D$. Let $c\in D$ and assume that $g$ is continuous at $c$ and that $f$ is continuous at $g(c)$. Then, $f\circ g$ is continuous at $c$.

### Proof

As $f$ is continuous at $g(c)$, we may apply Definition 1.18, (but using the symbols $y$ and $\eta$ in place of $x$ and $\delta$). Thus, given $\varepsilon >0$, there exists $\eta > 0$ such that

%%\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{6}%%

$$
\begin{align} \label {cont-f} \forall y \in E, \quad |y-g(c)|<\eta \quad \Longrightarrow \quad |f(y)-f(g(c))|<\varepsilon . \end{align}
$$

As $g$ is continuous at $c$, we may apply Definition 1.18 and find $\delta > 0$ such that

$$
\forall x \in D, \quad |x-c|<\delta \quad \Longrightarrow \quad |g(x)-g(c)|<\eta .
$$

Then for $x\in D$ such that $|x-c|<\delta$ we have that $g(x) \in E$ and $| g(x) - g(c)|<\eta$. Therefore we can use (1.7) with $y = g(x)$ and we get

$$
|f( g(x) )-f(g(c))|<\varepsilon .
$$
