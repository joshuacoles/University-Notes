# 1.6 The Weierstrass extremal value theorem

## Theorem 1.31 (Weierstrass Extremal Theorem).

Let $a, b \in \R$ satisfy $a<b$, and let $f : [a,b]\to \R$ be continuous on $[a,b]$. Then $f$ attains its bounds, that is, there exists $p, q \in [a,b]$ such that

$$
f(q) \leq f(x) \leq f(p), \quad \forall \, x \in [a,b].
$$

In particular, a continuous function $f : [a,b]\to \R$ is automatically bounded.

#### Proof

Let $S:=\{f(x)\,:\,x\in [a,\,b]\}$. Suppose $S$ has no upper bound. Then for all $n\in \N$ there exists $x_n \in [a,b]$ such that $f(x_n)> n$. In this way we have constructed a sequence $(x_n)_n$ contained in $[a,b]$. Therefore the sequence $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is bounded, and hence there is a subsequence, $(x_{n_k})_{k=1}^\infty$ and $c \in [a,b]$, such that $\displaystyle \lim _{k\to \infty }x_{n_k} = c$. As $f$ is continuous at $c$, the sequential characterisation of continuity, Theorem 1.21, implies that

%%\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{10}%%

$$
\begin{align} \lim _{k\rightarrow \infty } f(x_{n_k})=f(c)\in \R . \end{align}
$$

On the other hand,

$$
f(x_{n_k})>n_{k}
$$

and since $n_k\to \infty$ as $k\to \infty$ we conclude that

%%\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{11}%%

$$
\begin{align} f(x_{n_k})\to \infty \quad \text {as }k\to \infty . \end{align}
$$

Statements (1.11) and (1.12) contradict each another, and we conclude that $S$ is bounded above, that is, there exists $M\in \R$ such that

$$
\forall x\in [a,\,b]\quad f(x)\leq M.
$$

Since $S$ is bounded above and non-empty ($f(a)\in S$), it has a least upper bound, which we write as

$$
\gamma = \sup S \in \R .
$$

Since $\gamma$ is the least upper bound of $S$, for any $n\in \N$, there exists $p_n \in [a,b]$ such that

%%\seteqnumber{0}{1.}{12}%%

$$
\begin{align} \gamma - \frac {1}{n} < f(p_n). \end{align}
$$

Consider the sequence $(p_n)_{n=1}^\infty \subseteq [a,b]$. Since this sequence is bounded, there is a subsequence $(p_{n_k})_{k=1}^\infty \subseteq [a,b]$ and $p \in [a,b]$ such that $p_{n_k} \to p$. By continuity of $f$

$$
\lim _{k\to \infty } f(p_{n_k}) = f(p).
$$

But from (1.13) and $f(p_n) \leq \gamma$ we get

$$
\lim _{k\to \infty }f(p_{n_k}) = \gamma .
$$

Hence,

$$
f(p) = \gamma = \sup \left \{f(x) \, | \, x \in [a,b]\right \}.
$$

So, for all $x\in [a,\,b]$, $f(x) \leq f(p)$.

The existence of $q\in [a,\,b]$ such that $f(x)\geq f(q)$ for all $x\in [a,\,b]$ is proved similarly, (e.g., consider $-f$).

### Remark 1.32

In the previous theorems the following assumptions were made on a function $f: I\to \R$ where $I$ is an interval: $I$ is bounded and closed and $f$ is continuous on $I$. These assumptions are important, as the following examples show.

• The function $f: (0,1) \to \R$, $f(x) = \frac {1}{x}$ is continuous on $(0,1)$ but also unbounded.

• The function $f: \R \to \R$, $f(x) = x^2$ is continuous on $\R$ but also unbounded.

• Let $f: [0,1] \to \R$,

$$
f(x) = \left \{\begin {array}{ll} x, & \quad 0 \leq x < 1\\ 0, & \quad x = 1. \end {array}\right .
$$

Then $\sup \{f(x)\,|\,x\in [0,\,1]\}=1$, but there is no $p \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \leq f(p)$ for all $x \in [0,1]$,
