## 5.3 Chain rule

Let $U, V \sub \C$ be two [[Open Set|Open Sets]] and $f : U \to \C$, $g : V \to \C$ two functions such that $f(U) \sub V$.

Suppose that $z \in U$ is such that $f$ is differentiable at $z$ and $g$ is differentiable at $f(z)$. Then $g \comp f$ is differentiable at $z$ with $(g \comp f)'(z) = g'(f(z)) f'(z)$.

For proof we follow the logic of the real [[2.5 Chain Rule for Real Functions]].
