# 5.1 Complex derivative

Let $U \sub \C$ be an [[Open Set]] and $f : U \to \C$ a function. For $z \in U$, we say that $f$ is _complex differentiable_ (or _differentiable_ for short when there is no danger of confusion with [[2.1 Derivative|Real Differentiability]]) if

$$
f'(z) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(z + h) - f(z)}{h}
$$

exists. If so, then $f'(z)$ is called the _complex derivative_ of $f$ at $z$.

> **Note** that in this limit, the number $h$ is complex.

### Example 1

Consider the function $f : \C \to \C$ with $f(z) = z$. Then $f$ is differentiable at every point $z \in \C$, as

$$
f'(z) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{z + h - z}{h} = 1.
$$

### Example 2

Recall the [[Complex Conjugate]], defined by $\overline{x + iy} = x - iy$. If $f : \C \to \C$ is defined by $f(z) = \bar{z}$, then

$$
\frac{f(z + h) - f(z)}{h} = \frac{\bar{z} + \bar{h} - \bar{z}}{h} = \frac{\bar{h}}{h}.
$$

We claim that there is no limit as $h \to 0$. In order to see why, we first consider $h \in \R$. Then $\bar{h}/h = 1$. But for $h \in i \mathbb{R}$, we find that $\bar{h}{h} = -1$, regardless of the size of $|h|$. Therefore, there is no limit as $h \to 0$, and the function is _not_ complex differentiable anywhere.

> #todo Some notes about limits in complex plane, ie from all angles, etc. Stuff about continuity even.

Since this definition is so similar to the derivative of functions of one real variable, it comes as no surprise that the familiar differentiation rules still apply.
