# Relation between the Jacobian and Derivative

Suppose that $U \sub \R^n$ is an [[1.1 Analytic Space]] and $f : U \to \R^m$ is a function. Let $x \in U$ such that $f$ is [[2.1 Derivative|Differentiable]] at $x$. 

Then,

- The [[1.5 Jacobian Matrix|Jacobian Matrix]] $Jf(x)$ exists.
	- Ie., all the [[1.2 Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]] of all the component functions exist at $x$).
- Moreover, the [[Linear Map]] $df(x)$ is represented by the matrix $Jf(x)$ with respect to the [[Standard Basis]] of $\R^n$ and $\R^m$.
- In particular, the derivative $df(x)$ is unique.

## Proof

Let $j \in J_n$. By the condition of [[2.1 Derivative]], 

$$
\frac{f(x + he_j) - f(x)}{h} - df(x) e_j = \frac{h}{|h|} \, \frac{f(x + he_j) - f(x) - df(x)(he_j)}{\|h e_j\|} \to 0 
$$

as $h \to 0$. Hence

$$
\lim_{h \to \infty} \frac{f(x + he_j) - f(x)}{h} = df(x) e_j.
$$

Looking at the components of this equation, we conclude that the partial derivatives exist. Furthermore, the left-hand side is the $j$-th column of the matrix $Jf(x)$. Therefore, $Jf(x)$ is the matrix that represents $df(x)$.

**The converse is false**: if we have a function such that the Jacobian matrix exists, then it does _not_ follow that the function is differentiable.

### Example

The following is a variant of [[1.3 Directional Derivative#Eg 2 Failure under certain conditions]]. Define $f : \R^2 \to \R$ by

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
	\frac{x_1 x_2}{x_1^2 + x_2^2} & \text{if $x \neq 0$,} \\
	0 & \text{if $x = 0$.}
\end{cases}
$$

Then $\parfrac{f}{x_j}(0) = 0$ for $j = 1, 2$, and hence $Jf(0)$ exists.

However $f(h, h) = \frac{1}{2}$ for every $h \neq 0$. Thus $f$ is not continuous at $0$, so by the [[Contrapositive]] of [[2.2 Differentiability => Continuity]] it cannot be [[2.1 Derivative|Differentiable]] at $0$.
