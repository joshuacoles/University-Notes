# Derivative

Let $U \subseteq \R^n$ be an [[1.1 Analytic Space]] and $f : U \to \R^m$ a vector-valued function with $x \in U$. 

We say that $f$ is [[2.1 Derivative|Differentiable]] at $x$ if there exists a linear map $A : \R^n \to \R^m$ such that 


$$
\lim_{v \to 0} \frac{f(x + v) - f(x) - Av}{\|v\|} = 0.
$$

If so, then we write $df(x) = A$. This is then called the **Derivative** (or _Fréchet derivative_) of $f$ at $x$.

## Use as Approximation

This condition implies that the [[Linear Map]] $A = df(x)$ approximates $f$ near $x$ in the sense that 

$$
f(x + v) \approx f(x) + df(x) v $$

when $\|v\|$ is small. **Indeed, the difference between the left-hand and the right-hand sides tends to $0$ faster than $\|v\|$ as $v \to 0$**.

This formula may remind you of Taylor's theorem for functions of one variable, and is indeed its first order counterpart for functions of several variables.
