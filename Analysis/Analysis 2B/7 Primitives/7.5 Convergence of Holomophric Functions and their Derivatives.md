Let $U \sub \C$ be an [[Open Set]]. Suppose that $f_k : U \to \C$, for $k \in \N$, are [[5.4 Holomorphic Function|Holomorphic Functions]] that converge [[Pointwise Convergence|converge pointwise]] to $f : U \to \C$.

Suppose further that the [[2.1 Derivative|Derivatives]] $f_k'$ [[Uniform Convergence|converge uniformly]] to a function $g : U \to \C$. Then $f$ is [[5.4 Holomorphic Function|Holomorphic]] and $g = f'$.

## Proof

Let $z_0 \in U$ and choose $r > 0$ with $B_r(z_0) \sub U$. Then by [[7.3 Fundamental Theorem of Complex Integration]],

$$
f_k(z) - f_k(z_0) = \int_{[z_0, z]} f_k'(w) \rd w
$$

for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $z \in B_r(z_0)$. By the pointwise convergence of $f_k$ and the uniform convergence of $f_k'$, we conclude that

$$
\begin{equation*} f(z) - f(z_0) = \lim_{k \to \infty} (f_k(z) - f_k(z_0)) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \int_{[z_0, z]} f_k'(w) \, dw = \int_{[z_0, z]} g(w) \, dw. \end{equation*}
$$

Now Lemma [7.1](the-fundamental-theorem-of-complex-integration.html#lem:derivative-integral) implies that $f'(z_0) = g(z_0)$.
