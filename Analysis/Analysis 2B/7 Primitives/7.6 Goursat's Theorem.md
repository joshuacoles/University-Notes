# Goursat Theorem

If we want to show that a given function has a [[7.1 Primitives|Primitive]], [[7.3 Convex Domains]] tells us that we should examine integrals over [[6.1 Contours|Closed Contours]].

We first restrict our attention to [[6.1 Contours|Contours]] following the boundaries of triangles. When speaking of a triangle $T$, we mean a shape in $\C$ enclosed by three line segments, including the interior as well as the boundary. The boundary of $T$ is denoted by $\partial T$. If represented by a contour, we always assume that the orientation is **anticlockwise**.

Let $U \sub \C$ be an open set and $f : U \to \C$ a holomorphic function. Then for any triangle $T \sub U$,

$$
\int_{\partial T} f(z) \, dz = 0.
$$

## Proof

Set $T_0 = T$. We subdivide the triangle by drawing line segments between any two midpoints of the sides of $T$ as seen below.

This gives four smaller triangles, which we denote by $T_{01}$, $T_{02}$, $T_{03}$, and $T_{04}$. It is clear that

$$
\int_{\partial T_0} f(z) \rd z =
\sum_{j = 1}^4
	\int_{\partial T_{0j}} f(z) \rd z,
$$

as the contributions from the interior line segments cancel each other out. Consequently, by the [[Triangle Inequality]],

$$
\left|
	\int_{\partial T_0} f(z) \rd z
\right| \le \sum_{j = 1}^4 \left|
	\int_{\partial T_{0j}} f(z) \rd z
\right|,
$$

of which setting the interior triangle with the maximum of these 4 integrals to be $T_1$, we say,

$$
\left|
	\int_{\partial T_0} f(z) \rd z
\right| \le \sum_{j = 1}^4 \left|
	\int_{\partial T_{0j}} f(z) \rd z
\right| \le 4 \left|
	\int_{\partial T_1} f(z) \rd z
\right|.
$$

We subdivide $T_1$ the same way and find $T_2$ such that

$$
\left|
	\int_{\partial T_1} f(z) \rd z
\right| \le 4 \left|
	\int_{\partial T_2} f(z) \rd z
\right|.
$$

Moreover, $T_2$ is contained in $T_1$ and similar to $T_1$, and the diameters satisfy

$$
\mathop{\mathrm{diam}} T_2 = \frac{1}{2} \mathop{\mathrm{diam}} T_1.
$$

Continuing the same process indefinitely, we obtain a sequence of triangles $T_0, T_1, T_2, \dotsc$ such that $T_k \sub T_{k - 1}$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and

$$
\begin{equation*} \left|\int_{\partial T_0} f(z) \, dz\right| \le 4^k \left|\int_{\partial T_k} f(z) \, dz\right|. \end{equation*}
$$

Define $r_k = \mathop{\mathrm{diam}} T_k$. Then we also conclude that

$$
\begin{equation*} r_k = \frac{r_0}{2^k} \quad \text{and} \quad L(\partial T_k) = \frac{L(\partial T)}{2^k}. \end{equation*}
$$

From MA20218, we know that a nested sequence of compact sets has a non-empty intersection. This applies to the sequence $(T_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}_0}$. So there exists $z_0 \in \bigcap_{k = 0}^\infty T_k$. As $f$ is holomorphic, it is differentiable at $z_0$. Therefore, there exists a function $R : U \to \C$ with $\lim_{z \to z_0} R(z) = 0$ such that

$$
\begin{equation*} f(z) = f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(z - z_0) + R(z)(z - z_0) \end{equation*}
$$

for every $z \in U$. Integrating over $\partial T_k$, we conclude that

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_{\partial T_k} f(z) \, dz = \int_{\partial T_k} (f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(z - z_0)) \, dz + \int_{\partial T_k} R(z) (z - z_0) \, dz. \end{equation*}
$$

The function $z \mapsto f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(z - z_0)$ is a polynomial and has a primitive (namely $z \mapsto f(z_0) (z - z_0) + \frac{1}{2} f'(z_0) (z - z_0)^2$). By Theorem [7.1](the-fundamental-theorem-of-complex-integration.html#thm:fundamental-theorem), this means that

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_{\partial T_k} (f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(z - z_0)) \, dz = 0. \end{equation*}
$$

Furthermore, by Lemma [6.2](estimates-and-convergence.html#lem:ML),

$$
\begin{equation*} \left|\int_{\partial T_k} R(z) (z - z_0) \, dz\right| \le L(\partial T_k) \max_{z \in \partial T_k} \bigl(|R(z)| |z - z_0|\bigr). \end{equation*}
$$

Recall that $L(\partial T_k) = 2^{-k} L(\partial T)$. Since $z_0 \in T_k$, we can estimate

$$
\begin{equation*} \begin{split} \max_{z \in \partial T_k} \bigl(|R(z)| |z - z_0|\bigr) & \le \max_{z \in \overline{B_{r_k}(z_0)}} \bigl(|R(z)| |z - z_0|\bigr) \\ & \le r_k \max_{z \in \overline{B_{r_k}(z_0)}} |R(z)| \\ & = 2^{-k} r_0 \max_{z \in \overline{B_{2^{-k} r_0}(z_0)}} |R(z)|. \end{split} \end{equation*}
$$

Combining all the inequalities, we conclude that

$$
\begin{equation*} \left|\int_{\partial T_k} f(z) \, dz\right| \le 4^{-k} r_0 L(\partial T) \max_{z \in \overline{B_{2^{-k} r_0}(z_0)}} |R(z)| \end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*} \left|\int_{\partial T} f(z) \, dz\right| \le r_0 L(\partial T) \max_{z \in \overline{B_{2^{-k} r_0}(z_0)}} |R(z)|. \end{equation*}
$$

Since $\lim_{z \to z_0} R(z) = 0$, the right-hand side converges to $0$ as $k \to \infty$. Hence we have proved the Goursat Theorem.
