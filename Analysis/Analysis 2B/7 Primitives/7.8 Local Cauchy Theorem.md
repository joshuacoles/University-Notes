# 7.8 Local Cauchy Theorem

Suppose that $U \sub \C$ is [[Open]] and [[7.7 Star-Shaped Set|Star Shaped]]. If $f : U \to \C$ is [[5.4 Holomorphic Function|Holomorphic]], then it has a [[7.1 Primitives|Primitive]].

## Proof

This proof is similar to the arguments for the second statement in [[7.3 Fundamental Theorem of Complex Integration]]. 

Choose $z_0 \in U$ with the property as in [[7.7 Star-Shaped Set]],

![[7.7 Star-Shaped Set#^bcad8d]]

Then we define $F : U \to \C$ by the formula

$$
F(z) = \int_{[z_0, z]} f(w) \rd w
$$

valid by the containment of $[z_0, z]$ in $S$. 

Given $z \in U$, we may choose $r > 0$ such that $B_r(z) \sub U$ as $S$ is [[Open]] and that for $h \in B_r(z)$,

$$
F(z + h) - F(z) =
\int_{[z_0, z + h]} f(w) \rd z -
\int_{[z_0, z]} f(w) \rd z =
\int_{[z, z_0] + [z_0, z + h]} f(w) \rd z
$$

Now note that the triangle $T$ with corners $z$, $z_0$, and $z + h$ is contained in $U$. By [[7.6 Goursat's Theorem]],

$$
\int_{\partial T} f(z) \rd z = 0.
$$

This can be rewritten as

$$
 \int_{[z, z_0]} f(w) \rd w +
 \int_{[z_0, z + h]} f(w) \rd w +
 \int_{[z + h, z]} f(w) \rd w = 0.
$$

Therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*} F(z + h) - F(z) = \int_{[z, z + h]} f(w) \, dw. \end{equation*}
$$

By Lemma [[7.2]], it follows that $F'(z) = f(z)$. Hence $F$ is a primitive of $f$.

## Example 1

Given a closed contour $\gamma : [a, b] \to \C$, consider the integral

$$
\int_\gamma \cos(z^2) \rd z
$$

Without the local Cauchy theorem, it's not obvious that there is a primitive. But the function $z \mapsto \cos(z^2)$ clearly has a derivative everywhere in $\C$. So it is holomorphic. Moreover, the set $\C$ is star-shaped. Therefore, the function has a primitive and the integral vanishes.

Theorem [7.3](the-local-cauchy-theorem.html#thm:Cauchy) is formulated for star-shaped sets. This condition can be relaxed, but some assumptions on the geometry of $U$ are necessary. Roughly speaking, the statement becomes false if $U$ has holes.

## Example 2

Let $z_0 \in \C$ and $r > 0$. For $U = \C \setminus \{z_0\}$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the function $f_k : U \to \C$ given by $f_k(z) = 1/(z - z_0)^k$. For the contour $\gamma : [0, 2\pi] \to U$ with $\gamma(t) = z_0 + re^{it}$, we compute

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_\gamma f_k(z) \, dz = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{rie^{it}}{r^k e^{ikt}} \, dt = r^{1 - k} i\int_0^{2\pi} e^{i(1 - k) t} \, dt. \end{equation*}
$$

For $k = 1$, this gives

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_\gamma f_1(z) \, dz = 2\pi i. \end{equation*}
$$

It follows that $f_1$ does not have a primitive in $U$. Whenever we restrict the domain to a star-shaped subset $V \subset U$, however, Theorem [7.3](the-local-cauchy-theorem.html#thm:Cauchy) applies and gives a local primitive in $V$.

For $k \ge 2$, we compute

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_\gamma f_k(z) \, dz = 0. \end{equation*}
$$

For these functions, we do in fact have primitives. Setting

$$
\begin{equation*} g_k(z) = \frac{1}{(1 - k) (z - z_0)^{k - 1}} \end{equation*}
$$

for $k \ge 2$, we see that $g_k'(z) = f_k(z)$.
