# 7 Primitives

Similarly to integrals in real analysis, contour integrals are easily evaluated if a primitive of the integrand is known. But whereas for functions of a real variable, continuity is enough to guarantee the existence of a primitive, the situation is more complicated for complex variables.

In this chapter, we first discuss the complex counterpart to the fundamental theorem of calculus. Then we will see some results on the existence of primitives.

# 7.3 The local Cauchy theorem

With Goursat's theorem in hand, we can prove that holomorphic functions have a primitive, provided that the domain has a suitable geometry.
