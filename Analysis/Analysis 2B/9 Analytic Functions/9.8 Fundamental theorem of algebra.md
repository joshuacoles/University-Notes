# 9.8 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

Every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has a complex zero.

## Proof

Suppose that $p(z) = a_n z^n + \dots + a_1 z + a_0$ is a polynomial with coefficients $a_0, \dots, a_n \in \C$, where $a_n \neq 0$.

We argue by contradiction, assuming that $p$ is not constant (i.e., $n > 0$) and there is no zero (i.e., $p(z) \neq 0$ for every $z \in \C$). Then the function $q : \C \to \C$ with $q(z) = 1/p(z)$ is an entire function. As

$$
\lim_{|z| \to \infty} |p(z)| = \lim_{|z| \to \infty} |z|^n \left|a_n + \frac{a_{n - 1}}{z} + \dotsb + \frac{a_0}{z^n}\right| = \infty,
$$

we conclude that

$$
\lim_{|z| \to \infty} |q(z)| = 0.
$$

In particular, there exists $R > 0$ such that $|q(z)| \le 1$ whenever $|z| > R$. By the Weierstrass extreme value theorem, the function $q$ is also bounded in $\overline{B_R(0)}$. Therefore, it is bounded in $\C$. [[9.7 Liouville's Theorem|Liouville's Theorem]] now states that $q$ is constant, and so is $p$, in contradiction to the assumption.
