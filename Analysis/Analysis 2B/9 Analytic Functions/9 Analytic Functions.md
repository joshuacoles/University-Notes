# 9 Analytic Functions

Recall Taylor's theorem for functions of one real variable, which states that a $k$ times differentiable function can be approximated by a polynomial of degree $k$, and the coefficients are given by the derivatives of the function. Some (but not all) functions with derivatives of any order can even be expanded as a power series, called the Taylor series.

We will see that for holomorphic functions, not only do we automatically have derivatives of any order, but we can always represent them locally by power series. But first we discuss complex power series in general.

## Power Series
[[9.1 Weierstrass M-test]]

[[9.2 Radius of Convergence of Complex Power Series]]

## Analytic Functions

First we need define an [[9.3 Analytic Function]] as a function which can be expressed as a [[Power Series]] expansion. From this we can compute the power series of [[5.4 Holomorphic Function|Holomorphic Functions]] as so

- [[9.4 Power Series Expansion of Holomorphic Functions]]

from which we can prove that [[9.4 Holomorphic â‡” Analytic]] and hence the [[9.5 Infinite Differentiability of Holomorphic and Analytic Functions]].

### Entire Functions

The following theorem applies to functions that are holomorphic in all of $\C$.
