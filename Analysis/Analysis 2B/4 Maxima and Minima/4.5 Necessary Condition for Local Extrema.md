# Necessary Condition for Local Extrema

Suppose that $U \sub \R^n$ is an [[1.1 Analytic Space]] and $f : U \to \R$ is a function. If $x \in U$ is a [[4.2 Local Minima|Local Minima]] or [[4.1 Local Maxima|Local Maxima]] and $f$ is [[2.1 Derivative|Differentiable]] at $x$, then $df(x) = 0$.

## Proof

If $x$ is a [[4.2 Local Minima|Local Minima]] of $f$, letting $r > 0$ be such from the definition,

![[4.2 Local Minima#^c0a063]]

then $0$ is a Local Minima of the restriction of $f$ to some line parallel $e_j$ for some $j \in J_n$ ie,

> Huh this is literally function restriction from Alg 1A then re-parameterisation.

$$
\begin{gather}
g \colon (-r, r) \to \mathbb{R} \\
g(t) = f(x + te_j)
\end{gather}
$$

By premise we know $f$ is differentiable at $x$ and hence that $g$ is differentiable at $0$ with

$$
g'(0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}(x).
$$

hence asserting that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}(x) = 0$ from the equivalent definition in $\R$.

As this is true $\forall j$  it follows that $df(x) = 0$.

The arguments for local maxima are the same.

### Example

Consider the function $f : \R^2 \to \R$ with $f(x) = x_1^2 - 3x_1 x_2 + 4x_2^2 + x_1 - 8x_2$. What are its local minima/maxima?

We compute $Jf(x) = (2x_1 - 3x_2 + 1, -3x_1 + 8x_2 - 8)$. Any local minimum or maximum has to satisfy the equations

$$
\begin{align*}
2x_1 - 3x_2 + 1   &= 0 \\
-3 x_1 + 8x_2 - 8 &= 0
\end{align*}
$$

simultaneously. The unique solution is $x = (16/7, 13/7)$. At the moment we don't have any general tools to determine whether it is indeed a local minimum or maximum, but it is our only candidate. #todo
