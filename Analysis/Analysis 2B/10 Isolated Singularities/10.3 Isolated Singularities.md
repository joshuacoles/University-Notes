# Isolated Singularities

Suppose that $U \sub \C$ is an open set and there exists $z_0 \in \C \setminus U$ such that $B_r(z_0) \setminus \set{z_0} \sub U$ for some $r > 0$. Let $f : U \to \C$ be a [[5.4 Holomorphic Function|Holomorphic Function]] with the [[10.1 Laurent Series|Laurent Series expansion]]  

$$
f(z) = \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty a_k (z - z_0)^k.
$$

We say that $z_0$ is a

- *[[Removable Singularity]]* of $f$ if $a_k = 0$ for all $k < 0$, ^979c15
- *[[Pole]]* of order $k_0$ of $f$ (for $k_0 \in \N$) if $a_{-k_0} \neq 0$ but $a_k = 0$ for all $k < -k_0$, ^8f9ba4
- *[[Essential Singularity]]* of $f$ if there exist infinitely many $k < 0$ with $a_k \neq 0$.
