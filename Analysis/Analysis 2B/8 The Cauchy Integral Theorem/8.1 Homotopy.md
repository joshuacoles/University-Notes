# 8.1 Homotopy

Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be an open set. Two contours $\gamma_1, \gamma_2 \colon [a, b] \to U$ with $\gamma_1(a) = \gamma_2(a)$ and $\gamma_2(b) = \gamma_2(b)$ are called _homotopic_ in $U$ if there exists a continuous map $\psi \colon [a, b] \times [0, 1] \to U$ such that:

1. Boundary conditions on $s$.
$$
\begin{align}
\psi(t, 0) &= \gamma_1(t) &\Forall t \in [a,b] \\
\psi(t, 1) &= \gamma_2(t) &\Forall t \in [a,b] \\
\end{align}
$$

2. Fixed endpoints (boundary conditions on $t$).
$$
\begin{align}
\psi(a, s) &= \gamma_1(a) = \gamma_2(a) &\Forall s \in [0, 1] \\
\psi(b, s) &= \gamma_1(b) = \gamma_2(b) &\Forall s \in [0, 1]
\end{align}
$$

3. Contours along both axes.
	- $\psi_s(t) = \psi(t, s)$ satisfies the requirements of a contour forall $s \in [0, 1]$.
	- $\psi_t(s) = \psi(t, s)$ satisfies the requirements of a contour forall $t \in [a, b]$.

The idea behind this definition is that $\gamma_1$ can be deformed in a piecewise continuously differentiable way into $\gamma_2$, while leaving the initial and terminal points the same. We require that both contours are defined on the same interval here, but this is no significant restriction, because they can always be reparametrised accordingly.

The third condition on $\psi$ is not usually assumed in this context, but this extra assumption will make our life a bit easier. The resulting definition is still equivalent to the standard one.

## Example

Consider the contours $\gamma_1, \gamma_2 : [0, \pi] \to \C$ with,

$$
\begin{gather}
\gamma_1(t) = e^{it} \\
\gamma_2(t) = e^{-it}
\end{gather}
$$

Then the map,

$$
\begin{align}
&\phi : [0, 2\pi] \times [0, 1] \to \C \\ \\
&\phi(t, s) = \cos t + i(1 - 2s) \sin t
\end{align}
$$

has the required properties and hence these two contours are Homotopic in $\C$.

## Closed Contours

For closed contours, we relax the condition about the initial and terminal points, see [[8.2 Homotopy of closed contours]]

## Relation to Winding Number
Winding number is constant across a [[8.1 Homotopy|Homotopy]].
