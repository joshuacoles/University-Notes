# Cauchy Integral Theorem

Suppose that $U \sub \C$ is an [[Open Set]] and $f : U \to \C$ a [[5.4 Holomorphic Function|Holomorphic Function]].

If $\gamma_1, \gamma_2 : [a, b] \to U$ are two [[6.1 Contours|Contours]] that are [[8.1 Homotopy|Homotopic]] in $U$ (in general or [[8.2 Homotopy of closed contours]] sense). Then,

$$
\int_{\gamma_1} f(z) \rd z =
\int_{\gamma_2} f(z) \rd z.
$$

If $\gamma \colon [a, b] \to U$ is a closed contour that is [[8.2 Homotopy of closed contours#Null-Homotopic]] in $U$, then

$$
\int_\gamma f(z) \rd z = 0.
$$

## Proof

The second statement is an immediate consequence of the first one, so it suffices to prove the former.

### Surface Construction

Suppose first that $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ satisfy the conditions of [[8.1 Homotopy]]. Let $\psi : [a, b] \times [0, 1] \to U$ be the corresponding homotopy.

Let $C = \psi([a, b] \times [0, 1])$. As $\psi$ is continuous, this is a [[Definition 3.5|Compact Set]] in $U$. Therefore, there exists $r > 0$ such that $B_r(x) \sub U$ for every $x \in C$.

> Note that $\psi$ is a continuous map on the compact domain $[a, b] \times [0, 1]$. Therefore, it is in fact uniformly continuous. 
> 
> In particular, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that whenever we have $t_1, t_2 \in [a, b]$ and $s_1, s_2 \in [0, 1]$,
> 
>  $$ (t_2 - t_1)^2 + (s_2 - s_1)^2 < 2\delta^2 \implies |\psi(t_2, s_2) - \psi(t_1, s_1)| < r$$

### Subdivision

![[Cauchy.png]]

Subdivide the interval $[a, b]$ by choosing $t_0, \dots, t_K$ with $a = t_0 < \dotsb < t_K = b$ and $t_k - t_{k - 1} < \delta$ for $k = 1, \dotsc, K$.

Similarly, subdivide $[0, 1]$ by choosing $s_0, \dotsc, s_J$ with $0 = s_0 < \dotsb < s_J = 1$ and $s_j - s_{j - 1} < \delta$ for $j = 1, \dotsc, J$.

Consider the rectangles $R_{kj} = [t_{k - 1}, t_k] \times [s_{j - 1}, s_j]$ and their images $Q_{kj} = \psi(R_{kj})$ (see Figure [8.1](global-Cauchy.html#fig:rectangles)).

### Application

The boundary of $R_{kj}$ consists of four line segments. Restricting $\psi$ to any of these line segments gives rise to a contour in $U$.

The concatenation of all four of them, with the orientation taken anticlockwise when we move around $R_{kj}$, gives a closed contour in $U$, which we denote by $\p Q_{kj}$.

> We keep the orientation given by the boundary of $R_{kj}$, even if $\psi$ should reverse it.

By construction, we know that $Q_{kj}$ is contained in the disk $B_r(\psi(t_k, s_j)) \subseteq U$. Hence $\partial Q_{kj}$ is a contour in $B_r(\psi(t_k, s_j))$. This is a [[7.7 Star-Shaped Set]] and $f$ is [[5.4 Holomorphic Function|Holomorphic]] there, so [[7.8 Local Cauchy Theorem]] tells us that

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_{\partial Q_{kj}} f(z) \, dz = 0 \end{equation*}
$$

for $k = 1, \dotsc, K$ and $j = 1, \dotsc, J$. Hence

$$
\begin{equation} \sum_{k = 1}^K \sum_{j = 1}^J \int_{\partial Q_{kj}} f(z) \, dz = 0. \tag{8.2} \end{equation}
$$

^eq82

Now we note that many of the integrals in this sum partially cancel each other. For example, consider the line segment $\{t_k\} \times [s_{j - 1}, s_j]$, which is part of the boundary of $R_{kj}$. It also forms part of the boundary of $R_{k + 1, j}$, but with reversed orientation. Therefore, the corresponding integrals appear with reversed orientation in the above sum and cancel each other out. 

> This is similar to our considerations in logically proving Stokes Theorem from the Student's Guide book.

What is left in the end is exactly

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_{\gamma_1} f(z) \, dz - \int_{\gamma_2} f(z) \, dz, \end{equation*}
$$

and [[#^eq82|(8.2)]] implies that this difference vanishes.

For closed contours that are homotopic in the sense of [[8.2 Homotopy of closed contours]], the proof is essentially the same.

## Example

For a fixed $z_0 \in \C$, let $U = \C \setminus \set{z_0}$. For the contour $\gamma_1 : [0, 2\pi] \to U$ given by $\gamma_1(t) = z_0 + e^{it}$, we know that

$$
\int_{\gamma_1} \frac{\d z}{z - z_0} = 2\pi i
$$

by [[7.8 Local Cauchy Theorem#Example 2]]. This means that for any contour $\gamma_2$ homotopic to $\gamma_1$ in $U$, we also find that

$$
\int_{\gamma_2} \frac{dz}{z - z_0} = 2\pi i.
$$

This applies, for example, to $\gamma_2 : [0, 2 \pi] \to U$ with $\gamma_2(t) = z_0 + \rho(t) e^{it}$ for any piecewise continuously differentiable function $\rho \colon [0, 2\pi] \to (0, \infty)$ with $\rho(0) = \rho(2\pi)$.
