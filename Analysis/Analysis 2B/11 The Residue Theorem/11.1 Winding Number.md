# 11.1 Winding Number

Suppose that $\gamma : [a, b] \to \C$ is a [[6.1 Contours|Closed Contour]] and set $\Gamma = \gamma([a, b])$ to be the [[6.10 Curve of the Contour]]. 

For $z \in \C \setminus \Gamma$, the Winding Number of $\gamma$ with respect to $z$ is

$$
W(\gamma, z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{dw}{w - z}.
$$

## Example

Let $z_0 \in \C$. Consider the [[6.1 Contours#Circular Contour]]

$$
\begin{gather}
\gamma : [0, 2\pi] \to \C \\
\gamma(t) = z_0 + re^{it}
\end{gather}
$$

parametrising $\partial B_r(z_0)$. 

For $z \in \C \setminus \p B_r(z_0)$, what is $W(\gamma, z)$?

[[7.8 Local Cauchy Theorem#Example 2]] gives the answer for $z = z_0$, namely $W(\gamma, z_0) = 1$. For all other $z \in \C \setminus \partial B_r(z_0)$, we can use [[7.8 Local Cauchy Theorem]] to compute the winding number. 

If $z \in B_r(z_0)$, then $\gamma$ is [[8.1 Homotopy|Homotopic]] to $\partial B_1(z)$ in $\C \setminus \{z\}$. Since the function $w \mapsto 1/(w - z)$ is holomorphic in this set, it follows that $W(\gamma, z) = 1$. If $z \in \C \setminus \overline{B_r(z_0)}$, then $\gamma$ is [[8.2 Homotopy of closed contours|Null-Homotopic]] in $\C \setminus \{z\}$. Hence in this case, we conclude that $W(\gamma, z) = 0$.

The results from this example are consistent with the geometric interpretation, and so is the following statement.
