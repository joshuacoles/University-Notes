# The residue theorem

Let $U \sub \C$ be an open set and $\gamma : [a, b] \to U$ a contour that is [[8.2 Homotopy of closed contours#Null-Homotopic]] in $U$. Set $\Gamma = \gamma([a, b])$. Suppose that $z_1, \dotsc, z_N \in U \setminus \Gamma$ are finitely many points and $f : U \setminus \{z_1, \dotsc, z_N\} \to \C$ is holomorphic. Then

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_\gamma f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \sum_{n = 1}^N W(\gamma, z_n) \mathop{\mathrm{Res}}(f, z_n). \end{equation*}
$$

So in this situation, in order to evaluate the integral, all we need to do is find the relevant winding numbers and residues. The winding numbers are often geometrically obvious, and the residues depend only on the behaviour of $f$ near the singularities.

This can be seen as a collection of "exceptions" to the [[8.3 Cauchy Integral Theorem]], at [[Pole|Poles]]

## Proof

For each $n = 1, \dotsc, N$, consider the Laurent series expansion

$$
\begin{equation*} f(z) = \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty a_{nk} (z - z_n)^k \end{equation*}
$$

for $z \in B_r(z_n) \setminus \{z_n\}$, where $r > 0$. We are interested above all in the principal parts and define

$$
\begin{equation*} f_n(z) = \sum_{k = -\infty}^{-1} a_{nk} (z - z_n)^k, \quad z \in \C \setminus \{z_n\}. \end{equation*}
$$

Since by definition, these series converge for $z \in B_r(z_n) \setminus \{z_n\}$, they converge uniformly in $\C \setminus B_s(z_n)$ for any $s > 0$. So the functions $f_n$ are well-defined in $\C \setminus \{z_n\}$ and are holomorphic there by Corollary [7.2](the-fundamental-theorem-of-complex-integration.html#cor:derivative-of-limit).

Now define

$$
\begin{equation*} g(z) = f(z) - \sum_{n = 1}^N f_n(z), \quad z \in U \setminus \{z_1, \dotsc, z_N\}. \end{equation*}
$$

In $B_r(z_n) \setminus \{z_n\}$, we have the formula

$$
\begin{equation*} g(z) = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty a_{nk} (z - z_n)^k - \sum_{m \neq n} f_m(z). \end{equation*}
$$

Thus if we extend $g$ to $z_n$ by

$$
\begin{equation*} g(z_n) = a_{n0} - \sum_{m \neq n} f_m(z_n), \quad n = 1, \dotsc, N, \end{equation*}
$$

then we obtain a holomorphic function $g : U \to \C$. As $\gamma$ is [[8.2 Homotopy of closed contours#Null-Homotopic]] in $U$, Theorem [8.1](global-Cauchy.html#thm:Cauchy-integral-theorem) implies that

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_\gamma g(z) \, dz = 0. \end{equation*}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_\gamma f(z) \, dz = \sum_{n = 1}^N \int_\gamma f_n(z) \, dz = \sum_{n = 1}^N \sum_{k = -\infty}^{-1} \int_\gamma a_{nk} (z - z_n)^k \, dz, \end{equation*}
$$

the last identity following from the fact that we have uniform convergence of the principal parts of the Laurent series on $\Gamma$.

Finally, we note that for every $k \neq -1$, the function $z \mapsto a_{nk} (z - z_n)^{k + 1}/(k + 1)$ is a primitive of $a_{nk} (z - z_n)^k$. Hence

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_\gamma a_{nk} (z - z_n)^k \, dz = 0 \end{equation*}
$$

for $k \neq -1$. For the remaining terms, we observe that

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_\gamma \frac{a_{n, -1}}{z - z_n} \, dz = 2\pi i a_{n, -1} W(\gamma, z_n) = 2\pi i W(\gamma, z_n) \mathop{\mathrm{Res}}(f, z_n) \end{equation*}
$$

by the definitions of the winding number and the residue. Now it suffices to sum everything up.

## Example

Suppose we need to compute

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_{\partial B_2(0)} \tan z \, dz. \end{equation*}
$$

As we have seen in Example [11.2](residues.html#exm:tan), we have poles at $\frac{\pi}{2} + \ell \pi$, for $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}$, with residues $-1$. We can choose $U = B_3(0)$, then $\partial B_2(0)$ is [[8.2 Homotopy of closed contours#Null-Homotopic]] in $U$. Of all the singularities of $\tan$, only $\pm \frac{\pi}{2}$ belong to $U$. Clearly $W(\partial B_2(0), \pi/2) = 1$ and $W(\partial B_2(0), -\pi/2) = 1$. Hence

$$
\begin{equation*} \begin{split} \int_{\partial B_2(0)} \tan z \, dz = 2\pi i \mathop{\mathrm{Res}}\left(\tan, \frac{\pi}{2}\right) + 2\pi i \mathop{\mathrm{Res}}\left(\tan, -\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -4\pi i. \end{split} \end{equation*}
$$
