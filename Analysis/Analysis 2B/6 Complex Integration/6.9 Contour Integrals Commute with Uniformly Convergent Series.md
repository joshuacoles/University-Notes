# Contour Integrals Commute with Convergent Series

A clear Corollary of [[6.8 Contour Integrals of Uniformly Convergent Complex Functions is Convergent]] is the following.

Let $U \sub \C$ be an open set and $\gamma : [a, b] \to U$ a [[6.1 Contours|Contour]]. Set $\Gamma = \gamma([a, b])$. Let $(f_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of continuous functions $f_k : U \to \C$ and let $f : U \to \C$ be another continuous function. If $f = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty f_k$ uniformly on $\Gamma$, then

$$
\int_\gamma f(z) \rd z
= \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \int_\gamma f_k(z) \rd z.
$$
