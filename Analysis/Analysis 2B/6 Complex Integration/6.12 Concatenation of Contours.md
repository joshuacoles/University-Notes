# 6.12 Concatenation of Contours

Often it is convenient to concatenate different contours as follows. Suppose that we have the contours,

$$
\begin{align}
\gamma_1 : [a_1, b_1] \to U \\
\gamma_2 : [a_2, b_2] \to U
\end{align}
$$

where $\gamma_1(b_1) = \gamma_2(a_2)$, ie the terminal point of $\gamma_1$ coincides with the initial point of $\gamma_2$.

We can define $\hat{\gamma} : [a_1 + a_2, b_1 + b_2] \to U$ as follows:

$$
\hat{\gamma}(t) = \begin{cases}
\gamma_1(t - a_2)
&\text{if } a_1 + a_2 \le t \le b_1 + a_2, \\
\gamma_2(t - b_1)
&\text{if } b_1 + a_2 \lt t \le b_1 + b_2.
\end{cases}
$$

This is then also a contour in $U$, which first traces the curve given by $\gamma_1$ and then the curve given by $\gamma_2$. In this case, we can check that

$$
\int_{\hat{\gamma}} f(z) \rd z = \int_{\gamma_1} f(z) \,\d z + \int_{\gamma_2} f(z) \rd z.
$$

We use the notation $\hat{\gamma} = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2$ for this concatenation.

It follows in particular that

$$
\begin{equation*} \int_{\gamma - \gamma} f(z) \,\d z = 0 \end{equation*}
$$

for any contour $\gamma$ in $U$.

Despite the notation, the symbols $+$ and $-$ do _not_ correspond to a group operation here. In particular, we cannot combine any two contours this way, but only if their initial and terminal points coincide as described.
