# 6.2 Contour Integral

Let $U \sub \C$ be an open set and $f : U \to \C$ a [[Continuous]] function. Given a [[6.1 Contours|Contour]] $\gamma : [a, b] \to U$, the **Contour Integral** of $f$ along $\gamma$ is

$$
\int_\gamma f(z) \, \d z = \int_a^b f(\gamma(t)) \gamma'(t) \,\d t.
$$

Since $\gamma$ is only **piecewise** continuously differentiable, the derivative $\gamma'$ does not exist everywhere in $[a, b]$ in general. There are only finitely many points, however, where it does not exist, and they can be ignored for the purpose of integration.

More precisely, we can choose a function $g : [a, b] \to \C$ such that $g(t) = \gamma'(t)$ at every $t \in [a, b]$ where the derivative exists, and then we can replace $\gamma'$ by $g$ in the above integral. The function $g$ is not unique, but any two choices will differ at only finitely many points and will give rise to the same value.

This is closely related to [[3 Line Integrals]]

## Example 1

Let $f : \C \to \C$ be defined by $f(z) = z + 1$. The contour $\gamma = [1, 2 + i]$ is given by $\gamma(t) = (1 + i)t + 1$ and satisfies $\gamma'(t) = 1 + i$ for $t \in [0, 1]$. Hence

$$
\int_{[1, 2 + i]} (z + 1) \,\d z =
\int_0^1 ((1 + i)t + 2) (1 + i) \,\d t =
\int_0^1 (2it + 2 + 2i) \,\d t = 2 + 3i.
$$

## Example 2
Consider the closed contour $\gamma : [0, 2\pi] \to \C$ given by $\gamma(t) = \e^{it}$, describing the unit circle in $\C$, with $\gamma'(t) = i\e^{it}$. Also consider the function

$$
\begin{gather}
f : \C \to \C \\
f(z) = z^2 + 2\bar{z}
\end{gather}
$$

Then the integral of $f$ along $\gamma$ is given by,

$$
\begin{align}
\int_\gamma f(z) \,\d z
&= \int_0^{2\pi} f(\e^{it}) i\e^{it} \,\d t \\
&= i\int_0^{2\pi} (\e^{2it} + 2\e^{-it}) e^{it} \,\d t \\
&= i\int_0^{2\pi} (e^{3it} + 2) \,\d t \\
&= i\int_0^{2\pi} (\cos(3t) + 2) \,\d t
   - \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(3t) \,\d t \\
&= 4\pi i.
\end{align}
