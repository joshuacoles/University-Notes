# 6.10 Curve of the Contour and Reparametrisation

A [[6.1 Contours|Contour]] $\gamma : [a, b] \to \C$ gives rise to a [[3.1 Definition of a Curve|Curve]]

$$ \Gamma = \gamma([a, b]) \sub \C $$

However the same Curve $\Gamma$ arises from multiple different contours, which can be thought of as different Parameterisations of $\Gamma$. Note that in this context we consider curves be **undirected**.

The set of Contours which represent a given curve can be split into two different groups based on their orientation, ie the direction of the parameterisation.
