# Physical Example of Laplace's Equation

Consider the extension of [[15.1 Physical Derivation of the Heat Equation]] from a 1D rod to a 2D surface $D \sub \R^2$, giving a temperature distribution function of $T(x, y, t)$. By simple extension of the arguments presented we can show $T$ is described by the PDE,

$$
\pdiff{T}{t}
= \kappa \nab^2 T
= \kappa \(
	\frac{\p^2 T}{\p x^2} + \frac{\p^2 T}{\p y^2}
\),
$$

where $\kappa$ is the [[Thermal Diffusivity]]. This is the [[Heat Equation]] in 2D which reduces to [[15.2 Solving the Heat Equation under Homogenous Boundary Conditions#^1d-heat-eq|the previous 1D form]] if we assume that $T$ is independent of $y$.

If now we consider the case in which, after a long time, $t\to \infty$, the temperature in the surface reaches a steady state. Then if $T$ becomes independent of $t$, the 2D heat distribution is described by the equation

$$
\nabla^2 T = \frac{\p^2 T}{\p x^2} + \frac{\p^2 T}{\p y^2} = 0.
$$

This is [[Laplace's Equation]] in 2D.
