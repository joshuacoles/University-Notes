## 17.X Uniqueness of Solutions to Laplace's Equations

#### 18.3 Laplace’s equation in 2D with Dirichlet boundary conditions

To prove that solutions to Laplace’s equation in 2D, following definition 17.1, are unique we consider the BVP


$$ \begin{gather} \nabla ^2 u=0 \quad \text {for} \quad (x,y) \in \Omega , \\ u(x,y)=f(x,y) \quad \text {for} \quad (x,y) \in \partial \Omega . \end{gather} $$

Suppose that we have two solutions, say $U(x,y)$ and $V(x,y)$ of [[#^eq-18-10]]. Let $W(x,y) \equiv U(x,y) - V(x,y)$. Then $W(x,y)$ satisfies the BVP


$$ \begin{gather} \nabla ^2 W=0 \quad \text {for} \quad (x,y) \in \Omega , \\ W(x,y)=0 \quad \text {for} \quad (x,y) \in \partial \Omega . \end{gather} $$

Now use Green’s first identity [[#^eq-18-8]], setting $u = W$ and $v = W$ so that we have


$$ \iiint _\Omega \nabla W \cdot \nabla W\ \rd V = \iint _{\partial \Omega } W \pdiff {W}{n} \ \rd S \, . \nonumber $$
^eq-18-11


Examining the right hand side we observe that $W \equiv 0$ everywhere on the surface $\partial \Omega$ so this integral vanishes. Hence


$$ \iiint _\Omega \nabla W \cdot \nabla W \ \rd V = \iiint _\Omega \left (\pdiff {W}{x}\right )^2 + \left (\pdiff {W}{y}\right )^2 \ \rd {V} = 0. $$
^eq-18-11


This sum of squares can vanish only if $\partial W/\partial x \equiv 0$ and $\partial W/\partial y \equiv 0$, everywhere in $\Omega$. Hence $W$ is a constant. And since $W = 0$ on $\partial \Omega$, this constant must be zero. So in fact $W(x,y) \equiv 0$, so $U(x,y)=V(x,y)$ everywhere and the solution is unique. We have proved the following result.

###### Theorem 18.3

.  The solution of Laplace’s equation in 2D with Dirichlet boundary conditions, as set out in [[#^eq-18-10]] is unique.
