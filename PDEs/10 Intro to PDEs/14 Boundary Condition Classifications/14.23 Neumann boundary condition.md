## Neumann boundary condition
	
If the **normal derivative** is specified along the boundary, this is called a Neumann boundary condition. A Neumann boundary condition on $\p D_i \sub \p D$ takes the form
    
    
$$
\pdiff {u(\boldx )}{\boldn } \equiv \boldn \cdot \nabla u = h(\boldx ) \quad \text {for $x\in \p D_i$}.
$$

^eq-14-8

where $h(\boldx )$ is a given function.
