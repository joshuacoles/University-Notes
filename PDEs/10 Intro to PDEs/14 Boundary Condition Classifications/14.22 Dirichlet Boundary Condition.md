# Dirichlet boundary condition

If the **value** of the solution is specified along the boundary of the domain, this is called a Dirichlet boundary condition. A Dirichlet boundary condition on $\p D_i \sub \p D$ is

$$
u(\boldx ) = h(\boldx ) \quad \text {for $x\in \p D_i$}.
$$

where $h(\boldx )$ is a given function.
