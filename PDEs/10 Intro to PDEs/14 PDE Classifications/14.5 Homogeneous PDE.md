# Homogeneous PDE

A [[14.4 Linear PDE]] is **Homogeneous** if the fixed function $f$ from the the definition is,

$$
f(x,y,t)\equiv 0
$$

ie. there is no term that is independent of $u$ and its derivatives.

## Remarks

1. A linear homogeneous equation has $u(x,y,t) \equiv 0$ as a solution; and

2. All the linear equations from the example in [[14.2 Partial Differential Equation]] are homogeneous apart from Poissonâ€™s equation.
