## 15.4 Example of Inhomogenous Heat Equation

Consider the inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem with $L=\pi$, $\kappa =1$, $T_0=2$, $T_1=1$, and $u_0(x)\equiv u(x,0) = 0$ on the interval $0<x<\pi$. That is, solve


$$ \begin{gather} u_t = u_{xx} \quad \text {on $x\in [0, \pi ]$}, \\ u(0, t) = 2 \quad \text {and} \quad u(\pi , t) = 1, \\ u(x, 0) = 0. \end{gather} $$

We follow the procedure of section 15.3. First we solve the time-independent problem for $U(x)$ in system [[15.3#^eq-15-10]]:


$$ U’’ = 0, \quad U(0) = 2, \quad U(\pi ) = 1. $$

^eq-15-13


This has the solution


$$  U(x) = 2 - \frac {x}{\pi }. $$

^eq-15-14


Next we write the solution $u(x,t)$ as a sum of this time-independent part and a time-dependent function:

$$ u(x,t) = U(x) + \hat u(x,t). $$

We now observe that $\hat u$ satisfies the homogeneous Dirichlet problem:


$$ \begin{gather} \hat u_t = \hat u_{xx}, \\ \hat u(0, t) = 0 \quad \text {and} \quad \hat u(\pi , t) = 0, \\ \hat u(x, 0) = -U(x) + 0. \end{gather} $$

The solution to this homogeneous Dirichlet problem is just as we found in section 15.1. The solution is


$$ \hat u(x,t) = \sum _{n=1}^\infty B_n \e ^{-n^2 t}\sin (n x), $$

^eq-15-16

where


$$
B_{n} = -\frac {2}{\pi } \int _{0}^{\pi } \left ( 2 - \frac {x}{\pi }\right )\sin (nx)\, \mathrm {d}x.
$$

^eq-15-17


After integrating by parts we find that (check!)

$$ B_n = \frac {2}{n\pi }\Big ( (-1)^n -2\Big ), $$

so


$$ 
u(x,t) = \left ( 2 - \frac {x}{\pi }\right )+\sum _{n=1}^\infty \frac {2}{n\pi }\Big ( (-1)^n -2\Big ) \exp {\left (-n^2 t\right )}\sin (nx).
$$

Figure 15.1 shows the solution plotted at various times (and is constructed by summing the first 199 terms of the series). These sequence of graphs demonstrate why the function $U(x)$ in [[15.3#^eq-15-15]] called the _steady state or time-independent solution_. As $t\rightarrow infty$, all the terms in the series in [[15.3#^eq-15-19]] tend to zero (since $\exp (- n^2 t)\rightarrow 0$ as $t\rightarrow \infty$), and thus $u(x,t) \rightarrow 2-x/\pi$.

Figure 15.1: The solution to inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem for the heat equation in Example 15.3, plotted at $t=0$, $t= 0.001$, $t=0.1$, and $t=1$. In the figure for $t=1$, the function $2-x/\pi$ (the steady state solution) is shown with a thin line. Note the Gibbs oscillations when $t=0$; this is because of the jump in the initial condition across $x=0$ and $x=\pi$ at $t=0$.
