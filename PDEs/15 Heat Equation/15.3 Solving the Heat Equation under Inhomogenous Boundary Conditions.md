# Solving the Heat Equation under Inhomogenous Boundary Conditions

Consider again the system from [[15.2 Solving the Heat Equation under Homogenous Boundary Conditions]], but instead of $u(0, t) = u(0, L) = 0$ we solve the more general problem of,

$$
\begin{align}
u(0, t) = T_0 \\
u(L, t) = T_1
\end{align}
$$

representing a bar with ends which are at a fixed, but non-zero temperatures. This gives a full system specification as,

1. PDE, $u_t = \kappa u_{xx}$ ^pde
2. Boundary Conditions, $u(0, t) = T_0$ and $u(0, L) = T_1$ ^boundary-conditions
3. Initial Conditions, $f(x) = u(x, 0)$ ^initial-conditions

Which of course if $T_0 = T_1 = 0$ reduces to [[14.25 Homogeneous & Inhomogeneous Boundary Conditions|Homogeneous Boundary Conditions]] and thus the [[15.2 Solving the Heat Equation under Homogenous Boundary Conditions]] case. Indeed reducing the problem to this case it how we will solve it, by applying [[Linearity]].

To do this we split the solution into two parts:

1. $U(x)$ which satisfies the *stead-state heat equation*, and the inhomogeneous boundary conditions.
2. $\hat u(x, t)$ which satisfies the PDE and homogeneous Dirichlet conditions (the [[15.2 Solving the Heat Equation under Homogenous Boundary Conditions#^sys|Homogenous system from before]]).

This allows us to separate out the requirements of the boundary condition. Combining these two we get a full solution of,

$$
u(x,t) = U(x) + \hat u(x,t).
$$

^eq-15-8

Focusing first on $U(x)$ we know that it satisfies the time-independent steady state heat equation and thus,

$$0 = \kappa U_{xx}$$

along with the inhomogeneous boundary conditions,

$$
\begin{align}
U(0) = T_0 \\
U(L) = T_1
\end{align}
$$
This leads simply to the form $U(x)=Ax+B$, with applying the boundary conditions yields

$$ U(x) = T_0 + \frac {(T_1-T_0)}{L}x. $$

Now moving to $\hat u(x, t)$ we get a solution similar to [[15.2 Solving the Heat Equation under Homogenous Boundary Conditions]], bar that we now deal with $f'(x) = f(x) - U(x)$ in place of the original $f(x)$.
