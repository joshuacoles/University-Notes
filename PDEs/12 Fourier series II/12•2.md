#### 12.2 Functions of period $2L$ where $L\neq \pi$

Theorem 11.8 shows that the Fourier coefficients of $2\pi$ periodic function are given by [[12•2#^eq-11-16]] and [[12•2#^eq-11-17]]. More generally, for a function $f$ that is periodic with period $2L$, the formula [[12•2#^eq-11-16]] can be adapted.

###### Theorem 12.7

(Fourier coefficients for a $2L$ – periodic function).  Let $f$ be a periodic function with period $2L$. Then the Fourier series of $f$ is given by


$$ f(x) = \frac {a_{0}}{2} + \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\left [ a_n\, \cos \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right ) + b_n \, \sin \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right )\right ], $$

where the _Fourier coefficients_ of $f$ are given by


$$ \begin{align} a_n &= \frac {1}{L}\ \int _{-L}^{L} f(x) \cos \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right )\, \mathrm {d}x, \\ b_n &=\frac {1}{L}\ \int _{-L}^{L} f(x) \sin \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right )\, \mathrm {d}x. \end{align} $$

**Proof:** We could prove this by re-working the original derivation of the formulas for $a_n$ and $b_n$ directly in this generalised case (try this!), but here we choose to rescale the $x$ coordinate so that the function $f(x)$ becomes $2\pi$ periodic in the new rescaled coordinate. We can then apply the previous result. Noting that our rescaling needs to map $\cos (n\pi x/L)$ to $\cos (nX)$, we define a new coordinate

$$ X = \frac {\pi }{L}x, $$

and define a new function $g$ to be

$$ g(X) = f(x) = f(LX/\pi ). $$

It can be verified firstly that $g(X)$ is $2\pi$ periodic (in $X$) since

$$ g(X + 2\pi ) = f\left (\frac {L(X + 2\pi )}{\pi }\right ) = f(LX/\pi + 2L) = f(LX/\pi ) = g(X). $$

Hence we can write $g(X)$ as a Fourier series:


$$ \begin{gather*} g(X) = \frac {a_{0}}{2} + \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\left [ a_n\, \cos (nX) + b_n \, \sin (nX)\right ], \ \text {where} \\ a_n = \frac {1}{\pi }\ \int _{-\pi }^{\pi } g(X) \cos (nX) \, \mathrm {d}X, \qquad \text {and} \qquad b_n = \frac {1}{\pi }\ \int _{-\pi }^{\pi } g(X) \sin (nX) \, \mathrm {d}X. \end{gather*} $$

 Now take the above formulas and substitute $X = \pi x/L$ (and $\rd X = (\pi /L) \rd x$) and simplify.   □

**Remark:** In Theorem 12.7, we assumed that the Fourier series of the $2L$-periodic function is integrated over the range $[-L, L]$ but it is equivalent to integrate over the range $[0,2L]$ especially if the function is originally defined on $[0, 2L]$ and then periodically extended to $\mathbb {R}$. In this case we can equivalently write


$$ \begin{align*} a_n &= \frac {1}{L}\ \int _{0}^{2L} f(x) \cos \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right )\, \mathrm {d}x \, , \\ b_n &=\frac {1}{L}\ \int _{0}^{2L} f(x) \sin \left (\frac {n\pi x}{L}\right )\, \mathrm {d}x. \end{align*} $$

 which are equivalent to [[12•2#^eq-12-17]] on account of the periodicity.
