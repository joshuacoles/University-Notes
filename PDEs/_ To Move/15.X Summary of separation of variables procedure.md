## 15.2 Summary of separation of variables procedure

In fact, the steps we have carried out for the heat equation apply more generally to finding separable solutions to PDEs, so they are worth summarising as an ‘algorithm’ for this approach:

0. (If required) Reduce the BVP to one with homogeneous (i.e. zero) boundary conditions.
    
1. Assume that $u(x,t)= X(x)\,G(t)$, substitute into the PDE, and obtain separated ODEs for $X(x)$ and $G(t)$.
    
2. Solve the ODEs for $X(x)$ and $G(t)$.
    
3. Impose BCs to obtain a family of solutions depending on $n\in \mathbb {Z}$.
    
4. Use the Principle of Superposition to find a solution as a sum over $n\in \mathbb {Z}$.
    
5. Fix the unknown coefficients in the sum by applying the initial conditions.

In our study of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem [[15.2#^eq-15-2]] we did not need Step 0 because the problem already has zero boundary conditions. But we may need to do a little ‘pre-processing’ for other situations involving more general boundary conditions, which we will describe later, beginning in fact in the next section.
