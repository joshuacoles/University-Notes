### 10.0 The Bump Lemma

Let $f(\boldx)$ be a continuous function defined on a [[7.1 Domains|Domain]] $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb {R}^n$. Suppose it is the case that

$$ \int_V f(\boldx ) \, \rd {V} = 0 $$

for all sub-regions $V \subseteq \Omega$. Then

$$ f(\boldx ) \equiv 0 $$

in $\Omega$.

#### Proof

The basic idea in proving the Bump Lemma is the following argument for the converse:

- Assume that it is not the case that $f(\boldx) = 0$ everywhere.
- Consider some $\boldx = \boldx_0$ where $f(\boldx_0) = a$
	- With $a > 0$ wlog.
- Then by continuity there exists an open region $V$ around $\boldx_0$ where $f(\boldx)>a/2$ ([[Intermediary Value Theorem]]).
- So then the integral of $f$ over $V$ is at least $|V|a/2$ which implies that the integral does not vanish for every possible sub-region.

> **Note** this is only an intuitively argument, this is not an analytic proof.


#### Application to $\R$

Note in particular the application of this theorem to $\R$, consider a function defined on $[0, L]$. If we know that,

$$
\Forall [a, b] \sub [0, L] : \int_a^b f(x) \, \rd {x} = 0,
$$

then necessarily any continuous function $f$ must be identically zero: $f(x) \equiv 0$ in $[0, L]$.
