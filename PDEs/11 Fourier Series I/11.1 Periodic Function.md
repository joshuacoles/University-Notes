# Periodic Function

A function $f: \R \to \R$ is periodic with period $a>0$ if

$$
f(x) = f(x + a) \qquad \forall \, x\in \R.
$$

^6f3434

Note that the period is not unique, but the smallest such $a$ is called the **fundamental period** of $f$. Usually when we discuss the period of a function we will mean the fundamental period.

## Example

- The functions $\sin (\pi x/L)$ and $\cos (\pi x/L)$ both have periods $2L$. 
- Polynomial functions like $x$ or $x^2$ are not periodic.
- The constant function $f(x) = c$ is periodic **but does not have a fundamental period** (this is a rather perverse example of periodicity!).
