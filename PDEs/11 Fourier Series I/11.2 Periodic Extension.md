# Periodic Extension

Given a function $f : [x_0, x_0 + a) \to \R$ the **Periodic Extension**, $F$, is defined as follows.

Given $x\in \R$, find the unique integer $m$ such that $x - ma \in [x_0, x_0 + a)$. Then set

$$
F(x) = f(x - ma). $$

Then $F$ is a [[11.1 Periodic Function|Periodic Function]] with Period $a$.

%%## Periodic Extension

If we have a function $f$ defined on a **half-open interval**, say $[x_0, x_0 + a)$ (or closed and symmetric such that $f(x_0) = f(x_0 + a)$), we can extend it to be a periodic function by constructing shifted images of the function with period $a$ (see Fig. 11.1). This is called a periodic extension.
