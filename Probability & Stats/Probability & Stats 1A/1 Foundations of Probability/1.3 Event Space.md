# Event Space

A collection of [[1.1 Event|Events]] $\calF \sub \calP(\Omega)$ in some [[1.2 Sample Space]] $\Omega$ is called an **Event Space** or $\sigma$-algebra if it:

1. Contains the empty set, $\varnothing \in \calF$. ^sigma-1
2. Is closed under complement, $E \in \calF \implies E^c \in \calF$. ^sigma-2
3. Is closed under countable union, $\lst E1n \in \calF \implies \bigcup E_i \in \calF$. ^sigma-3

Associated with a sample space $\Omega$ there are many different event spaces.

## Immediate Implications

### Inclusion of the Sample Space

By [[#^sigma-1|(1)]] and [[#^sigma-2|(2)]] $\Omega \in \calF$ as $\Omega = \varnothing^c$.

### Closure under Countable Intersection

The Event Space is closed under countable intersection by [[De Morgan's Laws]]. Consider $\lst E1n \in \calF$.

By [[#^sigma-2|(2)]] this implies $\lst {E^c}1n \in \calF$ and hence by [[#^sigma-3|(3)]] also their countable union,

$$ \bigcup E_i^c \in \calF. $$

Taking the compliment of the above we obtain,

$$
\(\bigcup E_i^c\)^c
$$

which we know to be in $\calF$. Hence by [[De Morgan's Laws]] we have,

$$
\begin{align}
\(\bigcup E_i^c\)^c
&= \bigcap (E_i^c)^c \\
&= \bigcap E_i \in \calF
\end{align}
$$

## Examples

1. The collection $\set{\varnothing, \Omega}$ is an Event Space, often termed the *Trivial Event Space*.
2. If $E \subset \Omega$ then $\set{\varnothing, E, E^c , \Omega}$ is an event space. 
	- For example, $E\cup E^c = \Omega$, $E \cap E^c = \varnothing$ and so on.

## Why?

In this course we are considering sample spaces that are either *Finite* or *Countably Infinite* and the only event space we will consider is $\calP(\Omega)$. This begs the question, why do we consider $\calF$ instead of $\calP(\Omega)$?

In the case of **[[Uncountable]]** sets $\Omega$ (for example $[0, 1]$) then the set $\calP(\Omega)$ is to*o large* and contains sets which are said to be [[Non-Measurable]] (cf [[Measure Theory]]) and hence to which **we cannot assign probabilities**.

For [[1.2 Sample Space|Sample Spaces]] such as $\Omega = \R$ we typically take $\calF$ to be contain all sets of the form $[a, b], (a, b], (a, b), [a, b) ~\forall a, b \in \R$.
