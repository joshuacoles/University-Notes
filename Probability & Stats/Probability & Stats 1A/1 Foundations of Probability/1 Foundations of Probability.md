# Foundations of Probability

In probability theory, we use the term experiment to describe any process where the outcome is not known in advance with certainty but we can list the collection of possible outcomes. We are then interested in assigning probabilities to various combinations of outcomes that are of interest.

The aim of this course is to provide a solid foundation in discrete probability theory that will facilitate further study in probability and statistics. This immediately raises the question of what is the difference between probability and statistics?

The problems considered by probability and statistics can be thought of being inverse to each other. In probability theory we consider a process which has some randomness of uncertainty and look to model what will happen. In statistics, we observe that something has happened and try to infer what process could explain the observations.

- A probabilist might consider tossing a fair coin 50 times and ask what is the probability of obtaining 20 heads in these 50 tosses?
- A statistician might observe 20 heads in 50 tosses of a coin and ask whether the coin was fair?

Hence, statistics builds upon the foundation of probability theory whilst probability theory builds upon set theory which is where we begin.
