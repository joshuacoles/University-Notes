# Kolmogorov's Axioms of Probability

To complete our model of a random experiment we now assign probabilities to each event in the event space. There are a number of rules that need to be satisfied to make these assignments consistent.

Let $\Omega$ be a [[1.2 Sample Space|Sample Space]] and $\calF$ an [[1.3 Event Space|Event Space]] defined on $\Omega$. 

A Probability Measure $\P : \calF \to [0, 1]$ on $(\Omega, \calF)$ satisfies the following three Kolmogorov Axioms:

1. Strictly positive, $\Forall E \in \calF : \P(E) \geq 0$. ^ka1
2. Probability of universal event is 1, $\P(\Omega) = 1$ ^ka2
3. If $\lst E1n \in \F$ be a collection of disjoint events then. ^ka3
$$
\P\(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} E_i\) = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} \P(E_i)
$$ 

The triple $(\Omega, \calF, \P)$ is called a **Probability Space** or Probability Triple. It represents a mathematical model of a random experiment.
