# Event

An event is a collection of possible outcomes of an experiment, represented as a subset of the [[1.2 Sample Space]], $E \sub \Omega$.

If the outcome of the experiment is $\omega$ such that $\omega \in E$ we say that the event $E$ has occurred.

## Example

Consider the experiment of rolling a (six-sided) die. Then the possible outcomes, or sample points, are the scores $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$ so that the sample space is $\Omega=\set{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 }$. Examples of events include:

1. $E_1 = \set{\text{score is an even number}} = \set{2, 4, 6}$
2. $E_1 = \set{\text{score is bigger than \(4\)}} = \set{5, 6}$
3. $E_3=\set{\text{score is \(1\)}}=\set{1}$

Here we see in the that there is a class of events which contain only a single $\omega \in \Omega$.
