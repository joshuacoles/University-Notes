# Sample Space

The set, $\Omega$, of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the **Sample Space**. Each individual outcome, $\omega \in \Omega$, is called a **Sample Point**. 

We classify Sample Spaces into two types based on if they are [[Countable]] or [[Uncountable]].

## Example

1. Suppose that we toss a coin $n$ times and count the number of heads obtained, this has a Sample Space $\Omega = \set{0, 1, \dots, n}$.
 - This is clearly finite and thus this is a Countable Sample Space.

2. Suppose that we toss a coin repeatedly and count the number of tosses up to and including that when the first head is obtained. This has a sample space $\Omega = \set{1, 2, 3, \dots}$ which contains an infinite number of elements, isomorphic to $\N$ and is hence countable.

3. Suppose we consider the reaction time to a certain stimulus. The set of outcomes is then any positive real number so that $\Omega=(0, \infty)$. This set is not countable. In this course we shall primarily deal with sample spaces that are countable (essentially, discrete); next semester you'll study sample spaces that are uncountable (essentially, continuous).
