# Permutation

A **Permutation** is an ordered arrangement of objects, also known as an **Ordered Choice**.

## Ordered Choice with Replacement

The number of ways of choosing $r$ elements from a set of $n$ elements, **with replacement**, where the order in which they are drawn matters, is $n^r$.

```ad-example
title: Eg. Rolling dice

A fair die is rolled four times. You win if at least one of the rolls scores a $6$ otherwise you lose. What is the probability that you lose?

We can think of each roll as being the selection of an element from the set $\set{1, 2, … ⁡, 6} = J_6$ and duplication is allowed so it is as if we are sampling with replacement from $\set{ 1, 2, … ⁡, 6 }$. 

If $s_i$ denotes the score on the $i$th roll then the sample space is

$$
\Omega = \set{ (s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4) : s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4 \in J_6 } = (J_6)^4
$$

with the event that you lose being,

$$
\begin{align}
E
&= \set{\text{you lose}}
= \set{\text{you don’t roll a 6}} \\

&= \set{(s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4) : s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4 \in J_6 \setminus \set{6} } \\
&=(J_5)^{4}
\end{align}
$$

Thus, $|E|=5^{4}$. As the die is fair then all outcomes are equally likely and so applying the [[2.1 Principle of a Priori Equal Probabilities]] we get

$$
\begin{align}
\P(E) = \frac{| E |}{| \Omega |}=\frac{5^{4}}{6^{4}}=\frac{6 2 5}{1 2 9 6}. & 
\end{align}
$$

```

### Proof

Given a set $E = \set{\lst e1n}$ we apply the [[2.2 Multiplication Principle]] with $E_i = E$ and $m = r$ to obtain the result trivially.

## Ordered Choice without Replacement

We now consider the number of ways of choosing $r$ different elements in order from a set of $n$ elements. Thus, once an item has been chosen, it is not replaced and so the number of remaining elements decrease.

There are $n$ ways to choose the first item. Having not replaced this item, there are then $n - 1$ ways to choose the second item and so on so that once $(r - 1)$ have been chosen (and not replaced), there are then $n - (r - 1)$ ways to choose the $r$'th item.

Again using the [[2.2 Multiplication Principle]] we have $n \times (n - 1) \times \dots \times(n - (r - 1))$ which we can write in terms of factorials as,

$$
\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}.
$$

```ad-example
title: Eg. Plucking Cards

Picking 5 cards from a well shuffled pack; what is the probability that they are all picture cards.

Firstly we define our [[1.2 Sample Space|Sample Space]] of picking 5 cards without replacement to have size,

$$
|\Omega| = 52 \times 51 \times 50 \times 49 \times 48.
$$

We then consider the event in question, that they are all picture cards. There are $4 \times 3 = 12$ picture cards in a deck, and removing each one, we get,

$$
|E| = 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8
$$

And applying [[2.1 Principle of a Priori Equal Probabilities]] we get

$$
\begin{align}
\P(E) = \frac{| E |}{| \Omega |}=\frac{1 2 \times 1 1 \times 1 0 \times 9 \times 8}{5 2 \times 5 1 \times 5 0 \times 4 9 \times 4 8}=0.0003(\text{4dp}). & 
\end{align}
$$
```

# Number of permutations of $n$ objects

The number of permutations of $n$ objects, equivalently, the number of ways $n$ elements can be arranged in order is $n!$.

From Corollary 8 with $r = n$ gives $n!/0! = n!$.
$square$

### Example 19

1. How many distinct permutations of the word "METHODS" are there?
\
There are seven distinct letters so there are $7!=5040$ permutations.

2. How many disct permutations of the word "ALGEBRA" are there?

Notice that there are two "A"s. If we label the $A$s as $A_1$, $A_2$
then there are $7!$ permutations of the letters $A_1$LGEBR$A_2$ when
we disguish the $A$s. Consider any one of these permutations, say
$A_1A_2$LGEBR. This is equivalent to $A_2A_1$LGEBR: there are
$2!$ ways of permug the $A$s whilst keeg the reming five
letters fixed. Thus, there are $7!/2!=2520$ disct permutations.

We can generalise Example [19](#x14-2300919)(b) \into the follog
theorem which we'll revisit with Theorem [8](nose6.htm#x15-260048) \in
Section [2.4.2](nose6.htm#x15-260002).

## Theorem 7 (Number of disguishable permutations)
The number of disguishable permutations of $n$ objects of $k$
different types where there are $n_1$ of identical type $1$, $n_2$
of identical type $2$, $…⁡$, $n_k$ of identical type $k$, where
$n_1+n_2+dots +n_k=n$ is

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{n!}{n_1 ! n_2 ! \dots  n_k !}.

\tag{2.2}
\end{align}
$$
