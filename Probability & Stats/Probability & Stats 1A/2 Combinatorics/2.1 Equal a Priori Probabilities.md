# Equal a Priori Probabilities

The classical interpretation of probabilities is as a set of a priori equally probable [[1.2 Sample Space|Sample Points]] (these would be [[Microstate|Microstates]] in thermodynamics) thus giving us a value for the probability of a given even, without any additional knowledge of the system bar the [[1.2 Sample Space|Sample Space]].

For a finite Sample Space, $\Omega=\set{\lst \omega 1n}$, so $|\Omega| = n$, if the outcomes $\lst \omega 1n$ are viewed to be **equally likely** then the classical interpretation of probability defines the probability of each $\omega_i$ to be

$$
\P(\omega_i)
= \frac{1}{|\Omega|}
= \frac{1}{n},
$$

and, for any event $E \subset \Omega$, the probability of $E$ to be

$$
\P(E) = \frac{|E|}{|\Omega|} 
= \frac{\text{number of ways $E$ can occur}}{\text{total number of outcomes}}
$$

## Corollary, Calculating probabilities for equally likely events

The function $\P: \calP(\Omega) \to [ 0, 1 ]$ defined by equation ([2.1](#x12-19005r2.1)) is a probability measure on $(\Omega, \calP (\Omega))$.

### Proof

In terms of [[1.6 Specifying probabilities]] we have,

$$
p_i = \frac{1}{|\Omega|} = \frac 1n 
$$

and

$$
\P(E)
= \frac{|E|}{|\Omega|}
= \sum_{i \st \omega_i \in E} \frac{1}{|\Omega|}
= \sum_{i \st \omega_i \in E} p_i
$$
^event-prob

and so the result follows immediately.
