# Multiplication principle

Suppose that $E_1,E_2,…⁡,E_m$ are sets containing $n_1,n_2,…⁡,n_m$ elements, respectively. The [[1.2 Sample Space|Sample Space]] of selecting a single element from each is

$$
R = \pplst E1i
$$

where each $\omega_R \in R$ corresponds to a tuple $\omega_R = (\lst \omega1n)$ with 

with a size,

$$
|F| = \prod_i |E_i| = \prod_i n_i
$$

This has clear applications to Combinatorics where we consider sequences/combinations of independent events where each selection can be considered a separate set. For an example of this see [[2.3 Deck of Cards Example]].

## Proof

A proof by induction can be found in the original notes. I am lazy and this is trivial.
