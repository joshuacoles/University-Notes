# Principle of Equal a Priori Probabilities

The classical interpretation of probability has as its foundation the Principle of *a Priori* Equal Probabilities: ie that assumption that any two [[1.2 Sample Space|Sample Points]] $\omega_1, \omega_2 \in \Omega$ have an equal probability of occurring.

This allows us to define, through the use of [[1.6 Specifying probabilities]], the probability of any [[1.1 Event|Event]] in the [[1.3 Event Space|Event Space]] and thus form a [[1.3 Event Space|Sigma Alegbra]] with which to work **without any additional information** of the problem at hand.

## Finite Sample Space

In the case of a Finite Sample Space $\Omega = \set{\lst \omega 1n}$ we can determine a value for the total number of Sample Points,

$$
|\Omega| = n
$$

and hence on the assumption that are all **equally likely**, we can determine that they have probabilities

$$
\P(\omega_i)
= \frac{1}{|\Omega|}
= \frac{1}{n},
$$

and, for any event $E \subset \Omega$, the probability of $E$ to be

$$
\P(E) = \frac{|E|}{|\Omega|} 
= \frac{\text{number of ways $E$ can occur}}{\text{total number of outcomes}}
$$
