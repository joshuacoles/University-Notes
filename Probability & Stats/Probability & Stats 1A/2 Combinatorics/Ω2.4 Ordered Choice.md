# Permutation

A permutation is an **ordered arrangement of objects**. Suppose that $E = \set{\lst e1n}$ is a set and we wish to choose $r$ elements from $E$ and list them in order. How many ways can we do this?

The answer depends on if we allow choosing the same element more than once, if we are sample *with* or *without* replacement.

# Sampling with replacement

The number of ways of choosing $r$ elements from a set of $n$ elements, **with replacement**, where the order in which they are drawn matters, is $n^{r}$.

## Proof

This follows immediately and trivially from the [[2.2 Multiplication Principle]] with $m = r, n_i = n$ and hence,

$$
n_1 \times \dots \times n_m = \underbrace{n \times \dots \times n}_{m} = n^m
$$
