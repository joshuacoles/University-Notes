# Combinatorics

Combinatorics is the foundation of classical probability theory, providing a formula for the [[1.6 Specifying probabilities]] in terms of the [[1.2 Sample Space|Sample Space]] alone, with no additional knowledge required.

At its foundation is the principle of [[2.1 Principle of a Priori Equal Probabilities]] which **presupposes** that all possible elements of the Sample Space are **equally likely**.

This is done by the principle of [[2.1 Principle of a Priori Equal Probabilities]] taking the intuitive view that all possible outcomes of an experiment are equally likely.

This leads to the simple formula to the formula,

![[2.1 Principle of a Priori Equal Probabilities#^event-prob]]

for the general probability of a given event. When considering independent events we have the [[2.2 Multiplication Principle]].

The quintessential application is drawing cards from a well-shuffled deck, rolling a dice, etc as seen in [[2.3 Deck of Cards Example]].
