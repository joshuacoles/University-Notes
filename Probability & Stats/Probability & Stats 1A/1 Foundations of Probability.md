Foundations of Probability

---

In probability theory, we use the term experiment to describe any
process where the outcome is not known in advance with certainty but we
can list the collection of possible outcomes. We are then interested in
assigning probabilities to various combinations of outcomes that are of
interest.

The aim of this course is to provide a solid foundation in discrete
probability theory that will facilitate further study in probability and
statistics. This immediately raises the question of what is the
difference between probability and statistics?

The problems considered by probability and statistics can be thought of
being inverse to each other. In probability theory we consider a process
which has some randomness of uncertainty and look to model what will
happen. In statistics, we observe that something has happened and try to
infer what process could explain the observations.

- A probabilist might consider tossing a fair coin 50 times and ask
    what is the probability of obtaining 20 heads in these 50 tosses?
- A statistician might observe 20 heads in 50 tosses of a coin and ask
    whether the coin was fair?

Hence, statistics builds upon the foundation of probability theory
whilst probability theory builds upon set theory which is where we
begin.
