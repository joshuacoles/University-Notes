# 3.2 Multiplication law

We may re-arrange equation ([3.1](nose7.htm#x17-29002r3.1)) to obtain

$$
\begin{align}
\P(E \cap F) &= \P(E | F)\P(F). \text{(3.2)}
\end{align}
$$

which can be a useful way of calculating intersection probabilities as
conditional probabilities may be easy to calculate directly.

## Example 2 Two cards are drawn at random from a deck of 52 cards. What's

the probability that both are aces?

Let $E_{1}=\set{ \text{First card is an ace} }$ and
$E_{2}=\set{ \text{Second card is an ace} }$ then

$$
\begin{align}
\P(\set{ \text{Two aces} })=\P(E_{1} \cap E_{2})=\P(E_{2} | E_{1})\P(E_{1})=\frac{3}{5 1}\times\frac{4}{5 2}=\frac{1}{2 2 1}. 
\end{align}
$$

We can extend equation ([3.2](#x18-30001r3.2)) to intersections of $n$
events.

## Theorem 9(Multiplication law)

Suppose that $E_{1},…⁡,E_{n}$ are any events such that
$\P(E_{1} \cap \dots \cap E_{n - 1})>0$. Then

$$
\begin{align}
\P(E_{1} \cap \dots  \cap E_{n})=\P(E_{n} | E_{1} \cap \dots  \cap E_{n - 1})\dots \P(E_{3} | E_{1} \cap E_{2})\P(E_{2} | E_{1})\P(E_{1}). \text{(3.3)}
\end{align}
$$

### Proof

For any $k\in\set{ 1, … ⁡, n - 1 }$,
$(\cap ⁡)_{i = 1}^{n - 1}E_{i}\subset(\cap ⁡)_{i = 1}^{k}E_{i}$
and so, from Corollary [5](nose2.htm#x10-160245) (the containment rule:
if $E\subsetF$ then $\P(F)\geq\P(E)$),

$$
\begin{align}
\P(\cap_{i = 1}^{k} E_{i}) \geq \P(\cap_{i = 1}^{n - 1} E_{i})>0. 
\end{align}
$$

Thus, all of the conditional probabilities in equation
([3.3](#x18-30005r3.3)) are well defined and

$$
\begin{align}
 \P(E_{n} | E_{1} \cap \dots  \cap E_{n - 1})\dots \P(E_{3} | E_{1} \cap E_{2})\P(E_{2} | E_{1})\P(E_{1}) \\ &=\frac{\P (E_{1} \cap \dots  \cap E_{n})}{\P (E_{1} \cap \dots  \cap E_{n - 1})}\dots \frac{\P (E_{1} \cap E_{2} \cap E_{3})}{\P (E_{1} \cap E_{2})}\frac{\P (E_{1} \cap E_{2})}{\P (E_{1})}\P(E_{1}) \\ &=\P(E_{1} \cap \dots  \cap E_{n}) &
\end{align}
$$

giving the result. $square$

## Example 2 An electrician's tool box contains five good and two bad

fuses. Fuses are selected at random without replacement for testing.

1.

Find the probability that the first two chosen are defective.

Let $D_{i}$ denote the event that the $i$th fuse is defective and
$G_{i}$ that it is good so that $G_{i}^{c}=D_{i}$. Then

$$
\begin{align}
\P(\set{ \text{First two defective} }) &= \P(D_{1} \cap D_{2})  \\ &= \P(D_{2} | D_{1})\P(D_{1})=\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{2}{7}=\frac{1}{2 1}. 
\end{align}
$$

2.

What is the probability that the second defective fuse is found on the
third test?

Let $E$ be the event that the second defective fuse is found on third
test, then we can write $E$ as the following disjoint union:

$$
\begin{align}
E &= (G_{1} \cap D_{2} \cap D_{3})\cup(D_{1} \cap G_{2} \cap D_{3}) 
\end{align}
$$

so that, using first the probability of disjoint events (Corollary
[3](nose2.htm#x10-160063)) and then Theorem [9](#x18-300049),

$$
\begin{align}
\P(E) &= \P(G_{1} \cap D_{2} \cap D_{3})+\P(D_{1} \cap G_{2} \cap D_{3})  \\ &= \P(D_{3} | G_{1} \cap D_{2})\P(D_{2} | G_{1})\P(G_{1})+\P(D_{3} | D_{1} \cap G_{2})\P(G_{2} | D_{1})\P(D_{1})  \\ &= (\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{2}{6} \times \frac{5}{7})+(\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{2}{7})=\frac{2}{2 1}. 
\end{align}
$$
