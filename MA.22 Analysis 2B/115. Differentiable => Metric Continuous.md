Suppose,
- ${U \sub \R^n}$ is an [[Open Set]].
- $f: U \to \R^m$ is a function.

Given,
- $v \in U$
- $f$ being [[114. Derivative Map|Differentiable]] at $x$.

Then $f$ is [[Continuous]] at $x$.

## Proof

Let $A = \d f(x)$ be the [[114. Derivative Map|Fr√©chet Derivative]] of $f$ at $x$. Define the function,

$$
\begin{gather}
R : \R \to \R^m, \\\\
R(y) = \frac{f(y) - f(x) - A(y - x)}{\|x - y\|}.
\end{gather}
$$

Then letting $v = x - y$ (and thus $y = x + v$), we see by
[[114. Derivative Map#Definition]], that $\lim_{y \to x}R(y) = 0$ and moreover by the definition above that,

$$
f(y) = f(x) + A(y-x) + \|y-x\|R(y)
$$
