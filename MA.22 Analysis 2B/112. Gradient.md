Suppose,
- ${U \sub \R^n}$ is an [[Open Set]],
- $f: U \to \R$ is a function

Given,
- $x \in U$
- $j \in J_n$

If $f$ has a full set of [[111. Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]] at that point then the vector,

$$
\nab f(x) = \begin{pmatrix}
\parfrac{f}{x_1}(x) \\
\vdots \\
\parfrac{f}{x_n}(x)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

is known as the Gradient of $f$ and $x$.

## Gradient as Vector / Vector Operator

This operation can be likened to the operation,

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\parfrac{}{x_1} \\ \vdots \\ \parfrac{}{x_n}
\end{pmatrix}^T f
$$

where normal scalar multiplication is replaced with vector operator application. I am unsure of the rigour of this but it is worth exploring if we can frame it in a "nice" setting (cc: [[XXX. Vector Operator Algebra]]).
